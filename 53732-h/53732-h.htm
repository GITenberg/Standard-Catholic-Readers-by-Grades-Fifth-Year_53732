<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The selections in this reader for the Fifth Year
were chosen with reference both to their intrinsic
literary quality and to the varying capabilities of the
pupils who will read them. It is confidently hoped
that they will reach some interest of each child, and,
at the same time, help to form a correct literary
standard and encourage a taste for the best reading.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this series of readers, valuable
counsel and assistance have been given me by many
friendly educators and those in authority. I am
especially grateful to the Rt. Rev. John Lancaster
Spalding of Peoria for helpful advice and encouragement
in the planning and inception of the work;
also, to the Rt. Rev. James McGolrick of Duluth,
Minnesota, to the Rt. Rev. A. F. Schinner of Superior,
Wisconsin, and to other prelates and clergy who
have graciously given me assistance in various ways.
Many thanks, too, for kindly suggestions and criticisms
are hereby proffered to numerous friends among
those patient and inspiring educators&mdash;the Sisters.</p>

<h1>FIFTH YEAR</h1>

<h2 id="LITTLE_WOLFF_AND_HIS_WOODEN_SHOE">LITTLE WOLFF AND HIS WOODEN SHOE</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, so long ago that everybody
has forgotten the date, there was a little boy whose
name was Wolff. He lived with his aunt in a tall
old house in a city whose name is so hard to pronounce
that nobody can speak it. He was seven
years old, and he could not remember that he had
ever seen his father or his mother.</p>

<p>The old aunt who had the care of little Wolff was
very selfish and cross. She gave him dry bread to
eat, of which there was never enough; and not more
than once in the year did she speak kindly to him.</p>

<p>But the poor boy loved this woman, because he
had no one else to love; and there was never a day
so dark that he did not think of the sunlight.</p>

<p>Everybody knew that Wolff’s aunt owned a house
and had a stocking full of gold under her bed, and
so she did not dare to send the little boy to the school
for the poor as she would have liked to do. But a
schoolmaster on the next street agreed to teach him
for almost nothing; and whenever there was work he
could do, he was kept at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The schoolmaster had an unkind feeling for Wolff
because he brought him so little money and was
dressed so poorly. And so the boy was punished
very often, and had to bear the blame for all the
wrong that was done in the school.</p>

<p>The little fellow was often very sad; and more
than once he hid himself where he could not be seen
and cried as though his heart would break. But at
last Christmas came.</p>

<p>The night before Christmas there was to be singing
in the church, and the schoolmaster was to be
there with all his boys; and everybody was to have
a very happy time looking at the Christmas candles
and listening to the sweet music.</p>

<p>The winter had set in very cold and rough, and
there was much snow on the ground; and so the
boys came to the schoolhouse with fur caps drawn
down over their ears, and heavy coats, and warm
gloves, and thick high-topped boots. But little Wolff
had no warm clothes. He came shivering in the thin
coat which he wore on Sundays in summer; and there
was nothing on his feet but coarse stockings very full
of holes, and a pair of heavy wooden shoes.</p>

<p>The other boys made many jokes about his sad
looks and his worn-out clothes. But the poor child
was so busy blowing his fingers and thumping his toes
to keep them warm that he did not hear what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
said. And when the hour came, the whole company
of boys, with the schoolmaster at the front, started
to the church.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was very fine in the church. Hundreds of wax
candles were burning in their places, and the air was
so warm that Wolff soon forgot his aching fingers.
The boys sat still for a little while; and then while
the singing was going on and the organ was making
loud music, they began in low voices to talk to one
another; and each told about the fine things that
were going to be done at his home on the morrow.</p>

<p>The mayor’s son told of a monstrous goose that
he had seen in the kitchen before he came away; it
was stuffed, and stuck all over with cloves till it was
as spotted as a leopard. Another boy whispered of a
little fir tree in a wooden box in his mother’s parlor;
its branches were full of fruits and nuts and candy
and beautiful toys. And he said that he was sure of
a fine dinner, for the cook had pinned the two strings
of her cap behind her back, us she always did when
something wonderfully good was coming.</p>

<p>Then the children talked of what the Christ Child
would bring them, and of what He would put in their
shoes, which, of course, they would leave by the fireplace
when they went to bed. And the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
little fellows danced with joy as they thought of the
bags of candy and the lead soldiers and the grand
jumping jacks which they would draw out in the
morning.</p>

<p>But little Wolff said nothing. He knew that his
selfish old aunt would send him to bed without any
supper, as she always did. But he felt in his heart
that he had been all the year as good and kind as he
could be; and so he hoped that the blessed Christ
Child would not forget him nor fail to see his wooden
shoes which he would put in the ashes in the corner of
the fireplace.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>At last the singing stopped, the organ was silent,
and the Christmas music was ended. The boys arose
in order and left the church, two by two, as they
had entered it; and the teacher walked in front.</p>

<p>Now, as he passed through the door of the church,
little Wolff saw a child sitting on one of the stone
steps and fast asleep in the midst of the snow. The
child was thinly clad, and his feet, cold as it was,
were bare.</p>

<p>In the pale light of the moon, the face of the child,
with its closed eyes, was full of a sweetness which is
not of this earth, and his long locks of yellow hair
seemed like a golden crown upon his head. But his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
poor bare feet, blue in the cold of that winter night,
were sad to look upon.</p>

<p>The scholars, so warmly clad, passed before the
strange child, and did not so much as glance that
way. But little Wolff, who was the last to come out
of the church, stopped, full of pity, before him.</p>

<p>“Ah, the poor child!” he said to himself. “How
sad it is that he must go barefoot in such weather as
this! And what is still worse, he has not a stocking
nor even a wooden shoe to lay before him while he
sleeps, so that the Christ Child can put something
in it to make him glad when he wakens.”</p>

<p>Little Wolff did not stand long to think about it;
but in the goodness of his heart he took off the wooden
shoe from his right foot and laid it by the side of the
sleeping child. Then, limping along through the snow,
and shivering with cold, he went down the street till
he came to his cheerless home.</p>

<p>“You worthless fellow!” cried his aunt. “Where
have you been? What have you done with your
other shoe?”</p>

<p>Little Wolff trembled now with fear as well as with
the cold; but he had no thought of deceiving his
angry aunt. He told her how he had given the shoe
to a child that was poorer than himself. The woman
laughed an ugly, wicked laugh.</p>

<p>“And so,” she said, “our fine young gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
takes off his shoes for beggars! He gives his wooden
shoe to a barefoot! Well, we shall see. You may
put the shoe that is left in the chimney, and, mind
what I say! If anything is left in it, it will be a switch
to whip you with in the morning. To-morrow, for
your Christmas dinner, you shall have nothing but a
hard crust of bread to eat and cold water to drink.
I will show you how to give away your shoes to the
first beggar that comes along!”</p>

<p>The wicked woman struck the boy upon the cheek
with her hand, and then made him climb up to his bed
in the loft. Sobbing with grief and pain, little Wolff
lay on his hard, cold bed, and did not go to sleep till
the moon had gone down and the Christmas bells
had rung in the glad day of peace and good will.</p>

<p>In the morning when the old woman arose grumbling
and went downstairs, a wonderful sight met
her eyes. The great chimney was full of beautiful
toys and bags of candy and all kinds of pretty things;
and right in the midst of these was the wooden shoe
which Wolff had given to the child, and near it was its
mate in which the wicked aunt had meant to put a
strong switch.</p>

<p>The woman was so amazed that she cried out and
stood still as if in a fright. Little Wolff heard the
cry and ran downstairs as quickly as he could to see
what was the matter. He, too, stopped short when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
saw all the beautiful things that were in the chimney.
But as he stood and looked, he heard people laughing
in the street. What did it all mean?</p>

<p>By the side of the town pump many of the neighbors
were standing. Each was telling what had
happened at his home that morning. The boys who
had rich parents and had been looking for beautiful
gifts had found only long switches in their shoes.</p>

<p>But, in the meanwhile, Wolff and his aunt stood
still and looked at the wonderful gifts around the
two wooden shoes. Who had placed them there?
And where now was the kind, good giver?</p>

<p>Then, as they still wondered, they heard the voice
of some one reading in the little chapel over the way:
“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of
these&mdash;” And then, in some strange way, they
understood how it had all come about; and even the
heart of the wicked aunt was softened. And their
eyes were filled with tears and their faces with smiles,
as they knelt down together and thanked the good
God for what He had done to reward the kindness
and love of a little child.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EAGLE_AND_THE_SWAN">THE EAGLE AND THE SWAN</h2>

<p>Imagine yourself, on a day early in November,
floating slowly down the Mississippi River. The
near approach of winter brings millions of waterfowl
on whistling wings from the countries of the North to
seek a milder climate in which to sojourn for a season.</p>

<p>The eagle is seen perched on the highest branch of
the tallest tree by the margin of the broad stream.
His glistening but pitiless eye looks over water and
land and sees objects afar off. He listens to every
sound that comes to his quick ear, glancing now and
then to the earth beneath, lest the light tread of the
rabbit may pass unheard.</p>

<p>His mate is perched on the other side of the river,
and now and then warns him by a cry to continue
patient. At this well-known call he partly opens his
broad wings and answers to her voice in tones not
unlike the laugh of a madman. Ducks and many
smaller waterfowl are seen passing rapidly towards
the South; but the eagle heeds them not&mdash;they are
for the time beneath his attention.</p>

<p>The next moment, however, the wild, trumpet-like
sound of a distant swan is heard. The eagle suddenly
shakes his body, raises his wings, and makes ready for
flight. A shriek from his mate comes across the
stream, for she is fully as watchful as he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The snow-white bird is now in sight; her long neck
is stretched forward; her eyes are as watchful as those
of her enemy; her large wings seem with difficulty to
support the weight of her body. Nearer and nearer
she comes. The eagle has marked her for his prey.</p>

<p>As the swan is about to pass the dreaded pair, the
eagle starts from his perch with an awful scream. He
glides through the air like a falling star, and, like a
flash of lightning, comes upon the timid bird, which
now, in agony and despair, seeks to escape the grasp
of his cruel talons. She would plunge into the stream,
did not the eagle force her to remain in the air by
striking at her from beneath.</p>

<p>The hope of escape is soon given up by the swan.
She has already become much weakened. She is
about to gasp her last breath, when the eagle strikes
with his talons the under side of her wing and forces
the dying bird to fall in a slanting direction upon the
nearest shore.</p>

<p>The eagle’s mate has watched every movement that
he has made, and if she did not assist him in capturing
the swan, it was because she felt sure that his power
and courage were quite enough for the deed. She
now sails to the spot where he is waiting for her, and
both together turn the breast of the luckless swan upward
and gorge themselves with gore.</p>

<p>The bannered hosts of Macedon stood arrayed in
splendid might. Crowning the hills and filling the
valleys, far and wide extended the millions in arms who
waited on the word of the young Alexander&mdash;the
most superb array of human power which sceptered
ambition ever evoked to do its bidding.</p>

<p>That army was to sweep nations off the earth and
make a continent its camp, following the voice of
one whose sword was the index to glory, whose command
was the synonym of triumph. It now stood
expectant, for the king yet lingered.</p>

<p>While his war horse fretted at the gate, and myriads
thus in silence waited his appearance, Alexander
took his way to the apartment of his mother. The
sole ligament which bound him to virtue and to feeling
was the love of that mother, and the tie was as
strong as it was tender.</p>

<p>In mute dejection they embraced; and Alexander,
as he gazed upon that affectionate face, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
never been turned to him but in tenderness and yearning
love, seemed to ask, “Shall I ever again behold
that sweet smile?” The anxiety of his mother’s
countenance denoted the same sad curiosity; and
without a word, but with the selfsame feeling in their
hearts, they went out together to seek the oracles in
the temple of Philip, to learn their fate.</p>

<p>Alone, in unuttered sympathy, the two ascended
the steps of the sacred temple and approached the
shrine. A priest stood behind the altar. The blue
smoke of the incense curled upward in front, and the
book of oracles was before him.</p>

<p>“Where shall my grave be digged?” said the king;
and the priest opened the book and read, “Where the
soil is of iron, and the sky of gold, there shall the grave
of the monarch of men be digged.”</p>

<p>To the utmost limit Asia had become the possession
of the Macedonian. Fatigued with conquest,
and anxious to seek a country where the difficulty of
victory should enhance its value, the hero was returning
to Europe. A few days would have brought
him to the capital of his kingdom, when he fell suddenly
ill. He was lifted from his horse, and one of
his generals, unlacing his armor, spread it out for him
to lie upon, and held his golden shield to screen him
from the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>When the king raised his eyes and beheld the glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
canopy, he was conscious of the omen. “The
oracle has said that where the ground should be of
iron, and the sky of gold, there should my grave be
made! Behold the fulfillment! It is a mournful
thing! The young cypress is cut down in the vigor
of its strength, in the first fullness of its beauty. The
thread of life is snapped suddenly, and with it a thousand
prospects vanish, a thousand hopes are crushed!
But let the will of fate be done! She has long obeyed
my behest! I yield myself now to hers! Yet, my
mother!”</p>

<p>And the monarch mused in melancholy silence. At
length he turned to his attendants and ordered his
tablets to be brought; and he took them, and wrote,
“Let the customary alms, which my mother shall
distribute at my death, be given to those who have
never felt the miseries of the world, and have never
lost those who were dear to them;” and sinking back
upon his iron couch, he yielded up his breath. They
buried him where he died, and an army wept over his
grave!</p>

<p>When the intelligence of the death of Alexander
was brought to his mother, as she sat among her
ladies, she was overwhelmed by anguish.</p>

<p>“Ah! why,” she exclaimed, “was I exalted so high,
only to be plunged into such depth of misery? Why
was I not made of lower condition, so, haply, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
escaped such grief? The joy of my youth is plucked
up, the comfort of my age is withered! Who is more
wretched than I?” And she refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>The last wish of her son was read to her, and she
resolved to perform that one remaining duty and then
retire to solitude, to indulge her grief for the remainder
of her life. She ordered her servants to go into the
city and bring to the palace such as the will of Alexander
directed&mdash;selecting those who were the poorest.
But the messengers, ere long, returned, and said that
there were none of that description to be found among
the poor. “Go then,” said the queen, “and apply to
all classes, and return not without bringing some who
have never lost any who were dear to them.” And the
order was proclaimed through all the city, and all
heard it and passed on.</p>

<p>The neighboring villages gave no better success;
and the search was extended through all the country;
and they went over all Macedonia, and throughout
Greece, and at every house they stood and cried, “If
there are any here who have never known misery,
and never lost those that were dear to them, let them
come out, and receive the bounty of the queen;” but
none came forth. And they went to the haunts of
the gay, and into the libraries of the philosophers;
to the seats of public office, and to the caves of hermits;
they searched among the rich, and among the poor&mdash;among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the high and among the low; but not one
person was found who had not tasted misery; and they
reported the result to the queen.</p>

<p>“It is strange!” said she, as if struck with sudden
astonishment. “Are there none who have not lost
their friend? And is my condition the condition of
all? It is not credible. Are there none here, in this
room, in this palace, who have always been happy?”
But there was no reply to the inquiry.</p>

<p>“You, young page, whose countenance is gay, what
sorrow have you ever known?”</p>

<p>“Alas! madam, my father was killed in the wars
of Alexander, and my mother, through grief, has
followed him!”</p>

<p>The question was put to others; but every one had
lost a brother, a father, or a mother. “Can it be,”
said the queen, “can it be that all are as I am?”</p>

<p>“All are as you are, madam,” said an old man that
was present, “excepting in these splendors and these
consolations. By poverty and humility you might
have lost the alleviations, but, you could not have
escaped the blow. There are nights without a star;
but there are no days without a cloud. To suffer
is the lot of all; to bear, the glory of a few.”</p>

<p>“I recognize,” said the queen, “the wisdom of
Alexander!” and she bowed in resignation, and wept
no more.</p>

<p>Fair and softly, and step by step, did Don Quixote
and his squire wend their way through field and wood
and village and farmland. Many and strange were
their adventures&mdash;so many and strange, indeed,
that I shall not try to relate the half of them.</p>

<p>At length, on a sunny day, they came to the banks
of the river Ebro. As the knight sat on Rozinante’s
back and gazed at the flowing water and at the grass
and trees which bordered the banks with living green,
he felt very happy. His squire, however, was in no
pleasant humor, for the last few days had been days
of weary toil.</p>

<p>Presently Don Quixote observed a little boat which
was lying in the water near by, being moored by a rope
to the trunk of a small tree. It had neither oars nor
sail, and for that reason it seemed all the more inviting.</p>

<p>The knight dismounted from his steed, calling at
the same time to his squire to do the same.</p>

<p>“Alight, Sancho,” he said. “Let us tie our beasts
to the branches of this willow.”</p>

<p>Sancho obeyed, asking, “Why do we alight here,
master?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are to know,” answered Don Quixote, “that
this boat lies here for us. It invites me to embark in
it and hasten to the relief of some knight, or other
person of high degree, who is in distress.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if that is so,” said Sancho.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered his master. “In all the
books that I have read, enchanters are forever doing
such things. If a knight happens to be in danger,
there is sometimes only one other knight that can
rescue him. So a boat is provided for that other
knight, and, in the twinkling of an eye, he is whisked
away to the scene of trouble, even though it be two
or three thousand leagues.”</p>

<p>“That is wonderful,” said Sancho.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” answered Don Quixote; “and
it is for just such a purpose that this enchanted bark
lies here. Therefore let us leave our steeds here in
the shade and embark in it.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Sancho, “since you are the
master, I must obey. But I tell you this is no enchanted
bark. It is some fisherman’s boat.”</p>

<p>“They are usually fishermen’s boats,” said Don Quixote.
“So, let us begin our voyage without delay.”</p>

<p>He leaped into the little vessel. Sancho followed,
and untied the rope. The boat drifted slowly out
into the stream.</p>

<p>When Sancho saw that they were out of reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the shore and had no means of pushing back, he began
to quake with fear.</p>

<p>“We shall never see our noble steeds again,” he
cried. “Hear how the poor donkey brays and moans
because we are leaving him. See how Rozinante tugs
at his bridle. Oh, my poor, dear friends, good-by!”</p>

<p>Then he began such a moaning and howling that
Don Quixote lost all patience with him.</p>

<p>“Coward!” he cried. “What are you afraid of?
Who is after you? Who hurts you? Why, we have
already floated some seven or eight hundred leagues.
If I’m not mistaken, we shall soon pass the equinoctial
line which divides the earth into two equal parts.”</p>

<p>“And when we come to that line, how far have
we gone then?” asked Sancho.</p>

<p>“A mighty way,” answered the knight.</p>

<p>They were now floating down the river with some
speed. Below them were two great water mills near
the middle of the stream.</p>

<p>“Look! look, my Sancho!” cried Don Quixote.
“Do you see yon city or castle? That is where
some knight lies in prison, or some princess is detained
against her will.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Sancho. “Don’t
you see that those are no castles? They are only
water mills for grinding corn.”</p>

<p>“Peace, Sancho! I know they look like water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
mills, but that is a trick of the enchanters. Why,
those vile fellows can change and overturn everything
from its natural form. You know how they
transformed my Dulcinea.”</p>

<p>The boat was now moving quite rapidly with the
current. The people in the mills saw it and came
out with long poles to keep it clear of the great water
wheels. They were powdered with flour dust, as millers
commonly are, and therefore looked quite uncanny.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” they cried. “Are you mad, in
that boat? Push off, or you’ll be cut to pieces by
the mill wheels.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you, Sancho, that this is the place
where I must show my strength?” said Don Quixote.
“See how those hobgoblins come out against
us! But I’ll show them what sort of person I am.”</p>

<p>Then he stood up in the boat and began to call
the millers all sorts of bad names.</p>

<p>“You paltry cowards!” he cried. “Release at
once the captive whom you are detaining within
your castle. For I am Don Quixote de la Mancha,
the Knight of the Lions, whom heaven has sent to
set your prisoner free.”</p>

<p>He drew his sword and began to thrust the air
with it, as though fighting with an invisible enemy.
But the millers gave little heed to his actions, and
stood ready with their poles to stop the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Sancho threw himself on his knees in the bottom
of the boat and began to pray for deliverance. And,
indeed, it seemed as though their time had come,
for they were drifting straight into the wheel. Quickly
the millers bestirred themselves, and thrusting out
their poles they overturned the boat.</p>

<p>Don Quixote and Sancho were, of course, spilled
out into the stream. It was lucky that both could
swim. The weight of the knight’s armor dragged
him twice to the bottom; and both he and his squire
would have been drowned had not two of the millers
jumped in and pulled them out by main force.</p>

<p>Hardly had our exhausted heroes recovered their
senses when the fisherman who owned the boat came
running down to the shore. When he saw that the
little craft had been broken to pieces in the millwheel,
he fell upon Sancho and began to beat him unmercifully.</p>

<p>“You shall pay me for that boat,” he cried.</p>

<p>“I am ready to pay for it,” said Don Quixote,
“provided these people will fairly and immediately
surrender the prisoners whom they have unjustly
detained in their castle.”</p>

<p>“What castle do you mean? and what prisoners?”
asked the millers. “Explain yourself, sir. We don’t
know what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“I might as well talk to a stump as try to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
you to do a good act,” answered Don Quixote.
“Now I see that two rival enchanters have clashed
in this adventure. One sent me a boat, the other
overwhelmed it in the river. It is very plain that I
can do nothing where there is such plotting and counter-plotting.”</p>

<p>Then he turned his face toward the mill and raised
his eyes to the window above the wheel.</p>

<p>“My friends!” he cried at the top of his voice,
“my friends, whoever you are who lie immured in
that prison, hear me! Pardon my ill luck, for I cannot
set you free. You must needs wait for some other
knight to perform that adventure.”</p>

<p>Having said this, he ordered Sancho to pay the
fisherman fifty reals for the boat. Sancho obeyed
sullenly, for he was reluctant to part with the money.</p>

<p>“Two voyages like that will sink all our stock,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>The fisherman and the millers stood with their mouths
open, wondering what sort of men these were who had
come so strangely into their midst. Then, concluding
that they were madmen, they left them, the millers
going to their mill, and the fisherman to his hut.</p>

<p>As for Don Quixote and Sancho, they trudged sorrowfully
back to their beasts; and thus ended the
adventure of the enchanted bark.</p>

<p>Raphael of Urbino is called the prince of painters.
And a true prince he was in physical beauty, in graciousness
of manner, in kindness of soul, and in power
to command the love and admiration of all people with
whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>It would almost seem that the gentleness of St.
Francis himself had fallen upon him, for Raphael, too,
was born among the Apennines near the old town of
Assisi. The rugged mountains still rise hill upon hill
to the distant blue sky. Assisi, almost deserted, may
still be visited, and you may stand in the very house
where Raphael was born. You will find it on a steep
hillside in the little town of Urbino.</p>

<p>Urbino is built upon a jutting mountain cliff beneath
which is a rushing torrent. In the far distance one
may see on a clear day the blue Mediterranean. Urbino
was once a prosperous town over which a powerful duke
ruled, but now it is a quaint village whose one treasure
is the house on the steep hillside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Raphael’s father was Giovanni Santi, a painter of
some ability. His mother was the daughter of a rich
merchant. Raphael was born April 6, 1483.</p>

<p>No shadow fell across the path of the child until he
was eight years of age. Then a great sorrow befell him.
His mother died. His father, anxious that the child
should not miss a mother’s care, married again. His
stepmother treated him with all tenderness, and thus
the child grew strong and beautiful in the bright Italian
sunshine and the loving atmosphere of home.</p>

<p>He had few companions besides his father and
mother. He played much in his father’s studio, and
like Angelo learned in babyhood to use the tools of
art which later would bring him renown.</p>

<p>In 1494, while the boy was still young, his second
misfortune came. His father died. Raphael was left
under the guardianship of his stepmother and his
father’s brother, a priest.</p>

<p>For a time nothing was done toward his further
education. But an uncle who seemed to realize that
the lad had unusual genius for painting at last gained
permission to send him away to a master. He was
placed under the instruction of Perugino, who, it is
said, remarked, “Let him be my pupil; he will soon be
my master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Raphael remained in the studio of Perugino at
Perugia nearly nine years. Other students were with
him who afterwards became great artists.</p>

<p>A master like Perugino would often receive many
orders for pictures or frescoes which he could not execute
alone. So the less important work would be left
to students. This not only aided the artist, but it
made it possible for students to show their power.
If a young man had unusual talent, he was sure to seize
this opportunity to show his ability and attract the
master’s attention. Raphael’s earliest work was done
to assist Perugino.</p>

<p>After the death of Perugino, Raphael returned for a
time to Urbino. Here he painted for the reigning duke
St. George slaying the Dragon and St. Michael attacking
Satan. Both of these pictures are now in the
Louvre gallery at Paris.</p>

<p>But Raphael wanted especially to see the pictures
of Angelo and Leonardo, whose fame had spread to
the most remote valleys of the rugged Apennines.
So with a letter of introduction to the ruler of Florence,
Raphael in 1504 started upon his travels. His
letter, he knew, would insure him a welcome in Florence
at least.</p>

<p>As he walked through the streets of this beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
city he felt like a fairy prince in a land of magic.
Now he stood beneath the bell tower which Giotto had
designed, now he passed the wonderful bronze gates
which Ghiberti had cast, and now he studied the pictures
of Leonardo or Angelo which were in all the
brilliancy of fresh color.</p>

<p>New ideas crowded upon him, new inspiration roused
him. He was sure he could do more, much more, than
he had ever dreamed of doing before. Eagerly he began
to paint, and within a few months three Madonnas
were marked with his name. A fresco painting of the
Last Supper, which was probably executed by him
this same year, was discovered on the wall of a convent
dining room in 1845.</p>

<p>He had been gone not quite a year when he returned
to Urbino to complete some work which he had before
undertaken. The influence of Florence was seen at
once in both color and form. He was a finer artist.</p>

<p>All that northern Italy could offer, Raphael had now
seen. But the art of Rome excelled the art of Florence.
Angelo was at that very time hard at work
upon the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. Leonardo
in Milan had amazed Italy and the world by his
Last Supper. He, too, was soon to be in Rome.
Hither, in 1506, Raphael went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A young man of handsome, courtly appearance and
gracious manners, with many friends and no enemies,
fortune truly favored him! The Pope received him
gladly and soon commissioned him to decorate the hall
of the Vatican.</p>

<p>Two of the greatest artists of any age were now working
almost side by side, Michael Angelo and Raphael
of Urbino. Often one or the other would stand by his
rival and watch his brush. Yet neither ever spoke.
Each admired the other and each was known to defend
the other under the attacks of inferior artists.</p>

<p>Raphael worked steadily in the Vatican hall. Perhaps
the most pleasing of these frescoes is the one which
shows the Church in heaven and the Church on earth.</p>

<p>The fresco is divided into two sections. The upper
one shows the Almighty Father in the midst of angels.
Below Him is Christ enthroned, with the Virgin and
St. John the Baptist. Beneath the throne is the Dove
of the Holy Spirit. In the lower fresco appear St.
John, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Gregory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>At No. 124 Via Coronari, near the St. Angelo bridge,
is the four-story house where Raphael lived during his
first four years in Rome.</p>

<p>Raphael was admitted in 1514 into the Fraternity of
the Body of Christ, and his many Madonnas of rare
beauty were doubtless inspired by his devout spirit.</p>

<p>During his stay in Rome Raphael set up a studio to
which many students flocked. They loved him both
as friend and master, and he was untiring in his efforts
to instruct and inspire them.</p>

<p>He was commissioned by the Pope with the task of
making certain decorations for the Sistine Chapel.
They were to take the form of tapestries with which
the chapel would be adorned on great festival occasions.
There were ten of these, all telling some Bible story in
the life of Christ or one of His immediate followers.</p>

<p>The last of the series is the Coronation of the Virgin.
It shows Christ on his throne crowning the Madonna.
The Father and the Holy Spirit are seen above and
St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist below.</p>

<p>As yet nothing has been said of the painting by
which the name of Raphael is best known, the Sistine
Madonna. It was painted in 1518 for the Benedictine
Monastery of San Sisto at Piacenza. In 1754 it was
purchased by Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
forty thousand dollars. It was received in Dresden
with great rejoicing, and the throne of Saxony was
moved to give it a suitable place. It is now in the
Dresden gallery.</p>

<p>Another favorite is the Madonna of the Chair. This
shows the Madonna, seated, holding the child. “The
dress of the mother is light blue; the mantle about
her shoulder is green with red and willow-green stripes
and a gold-embroidered border; her sleeves are red
faced with gold at the wrists. A grayish-brown veil
with reddish-brown stripes is wound around her head.
The child’s dress is orange colored; the back of the
chair is red.” Such is the description given by
Grimm.</p>

<p>At the time of his death Raphael was putting forth
every effort to finish his noble conception of the Transfiguration.
It is now, as he left it, in the Vatican.</p>

<p>On the night of Good Friday, April 6, 1520, at the
age of thirty-seven, Raphael died. In his beautiful
home, where the people of Rome might do him honor,
the unfinished Transfiguration beside him, in the midst
of lighted tapers, he lay in state until the body was
carried to the Pantheon. In the procession also was
carried the great picture.</p>

dead.</p>

<p>And it chanced that a certain priest went down the

<p>It was very late in the night when the sentence was
pronounced, and the prisoner was asleep. The lieutenant
was unwilling to disturb his rest for that time,
and so did not awaken him, but in the morning before
five of the clock he came to him in his chamber in the
Bell Tower, and found him yet asleep in his bed.</p>

<p>He awakened the good father, and explained that
he was come to him on a message from the king. Then,
with some persuasion, he said that he should remember
himself to be an old man, and that he could not expect
by course of nature to live much longer. Finally he
informed him that he was come to signify unto him that
the king’s pleasure was he should suffer death that
forenoon.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered this blessed father, “if this be your
errand, you bring me no great news. I have long expected
this message. And I most humbly thank the
king’s majesty that it has pleased him to rid me from
all this worldly business, and I thank you also for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tidings. But I pray you, Mr. Lieutenant, when is
mine hour that I must go hence?”</p>

<p>“Your hour,” said the lieutenant, “must be nine of
the clock.”</p>

<p>“And what hour is it now?” said he.</p>

<p>“It is now about five,” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said he, “let me by your patience sleep
an hour or two, for I have slept very little this night.
My rest has been very much broken, not for any fear
of death, I thank God, but by reason of my great infirmity
and weakness.”</p>

<p>“The king’s further pleasure is,” said the lieutenant,
“that you should not talk much. Especially you must
not say anything touching his majesty, whereby the
people should have any cause to think ill of him or
of his proceedings.”</p>

<p>“For that,” said the father, “you shall see me order
myself well. For, by God’s grace, neither the king,
nor any man else, shall have occasion to mislike my
words.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant then departed from him, and so the
prisoner, falling again to rest, slept soundly two hours
and more.</p>

<p>After he was waked again he called to his man to
help him up. Then he commanded him to take away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the shirt of hair (which he was accustomed to wear on
his back) and to convey it secretly out of the house.
Then he bade him bring a clean white shirt, and all
the best apparel he had, as cleanly bright as possible.</p>

<p>While he was dressing himself, he appeared to have
more curiosity and care for the fine and cleanly wearing
of his apparel that day than had ever been his wont
before. His man asked him what this sudden change
meant, since he must know well enough that he must
put off all again within two hours and lose it.</p>

<p>“What of that?” said the father. “Dost thou not
mark that this is our wedding day, and that it is necessary
for us to use more cleanliness for solemnity of
the marriage?”</p>

<p>About nine of the clock the lieutenant came again to
his prison. Finding him almost ready, he said that
he was now come for him.</p>

<p>“I will wait upon you straight,” said the father, “as
fast as this thin body of mine will give me leave.”
Then he turned to his man and said, “Reach me my
fur cape to put about my neck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord,” said the lieutenant, “why need you
be so careful for your health for this little while?
Your lordship knoweth that it is not much above an
hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think no otherwise,” said this blessed father.
“But in the meantime I will keep myself as well as
I can, till the very time of my execution. I have, I
thank our Lord, a very good desire and willing mind
to die at this present time, and so trust of His infinite
mercy and goodness He will continue this desire.
Nevertheless, I will not willingly hinder my health
for one minute of an hour. Indeed, I will prolong the
same as long as I can by such reasonable ways and
means as Almighty God hath provided for me.”</p>

<p>Then, taking a little book in his hand, which was a
New Testament lying by him, he made a cross on his
forehead and went out of his prison door with the
lieutenant. He was so weak that he was scarce able
to go down the stairs, and at the stairs-foot he was
taken up in a chair between two of the lieutenant’s
men. These carried him to the Tower gate to be
delivered to the sheriffs of London for execution.</p>

<p>When they were come to the farthest wall of the
Tower, they rested there with him a space; and an
officer was sent on before to know in what readiness
the sheriffs were to receive him. As they were resting
here, the father rose out of his chair, and stood on his
feet, leaning his shoulder to the wall. Then, lifting his
eyes towards heaven, he opened his little book in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hand, and said, “O Lord, this is the last time that ever
I shall open this book; let some comfortable place now
chance unto me whereby I thy poor servant may glorify
Thee in this my last hour.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the book, and the first thing that
came to his sight were these words: “This is life everlasting,
that they may know Thee the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent. I have
glorified Thee upon earth, I have finished the work
Thou gavest me to do.” Having read these words, he
shut the book together and said, “Here is even learning
enough for me to my life’s end.”</p>

<p>The sheriff was now ready for him. So he was taken
up again by certain of the sheriff’s men, and, guarded
by many armed men, he was carried to the scaffold on
Tower Hill, otherwise called East Smithfield. He
was seen to be praying all the way, and pondering
upon the words that he had read.</p>

<p>When he was come to the foot of the scaffold, they
that carried him offered to help him up the stairs; but
he said, “Nay, masters, since I have come so far let
me alone, and you shall see me shift for myself well
enough.” So he went up the stairs without any help,
so lively that it was a marvel to them that knew before
of his weakness. As he was mounting up the stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the southeast sun shined very bright in his face. Observing
this, he said to himself these words, lifting up
his hands, “Come ye to Him and be enlightened; and
your faces shall not be confounded.”</p>

<p>By the time he was on the scaffold, it was about ten
of the clock. The executioner, being ready to do his
office, kneeled down to him (as the fashion is) and
asked his forgiveness.</p>

<p>“I forgive thee,” said the father, “with all my heart,
and I trust thou shalt see me overcome this storm
lustily.”</p>

<p>Then was his gown and fur cape taken from him, and
he stood in his doublet and hose, in sight of all the
people. There was to be seen a long, lean, and slender
body, having on it little other substance besides the
skin and bones. Indeed, so thin and emaciated was
he that those who beheld him marveled much to see
a living man so far consumed. Therefore, it appeared
monstrous that the king could be so cruel as to put
such a man to death as he was, even though he had
been a real offender against the law.</p>

<p>If he had been in the Turk’s dominion, and there
found guilty of some great offense, yet methinks the
Turk would never have put him to death being already
so near death. For it is an horrible and exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
cruelty to kill that thing which is presently dying,
except it be for pity’s sake to rid it from longer pain.
Therefore, it may be thought that the cruelty and hard
heart of King Henry in this point passed all the Turks
and tyrants that ever have been heard or read of.</p>

<p>After speaking a few words the father kneeled down
on his knees and said certain prayers. Then came the
executioner and bound a handkerchief about his eyes.
This holy father, lifting up his hands and heart to
heaven, said a few other prayers, which were not long
but fervent and devout, which being ended, he laid his
holy head down over the midst of a little block.…
And so his immortal soul mounted to the blissful joys
of Heaven.</p>

<p>About six hundred years after the birth of Christ,
a child named Mohammed was born in the city of
Mecca in Arabia. The father of Mohammed died when
the child was still a babe, and his mother was very
poor. During his boyhood he earned a scanty living
by tending the flocks of his neighbors, and much of
his time was spent in the desert.</p>

<p>Even when young, Mohammed seemed to be religious.
He often went to a cave a few miles from Mecca, and
stayed there alone for days at a time. He claimed that
he had visions in which the angel Gabriel came down
to him, and told him many things which he should tell
the people of Arabia. When he was forty years old,
he went forth to preach, saying that he was the prophet
of God.</p>

<p>At the end of three years he had forty followers. The
people of Mecca, however, did not believe him to be a
prophet. They were for the most part idolaters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
as Mohammed preached against idolatry, they finally
drove him from the city.</p>

<p>He and his followers then went to the city of Medina.
The inhabitants of that city received them kindly, and
Mohammed was able to raise an army with which to
overcome his enemies.</p>

<p>Mohammed was a very shrewd man, and among
other things he was careful to teach his followers that
the hour of each man’s death was fixed. Hence one
was as safe in battle as at home. This belief, of course,
helped his soldiers to fight bravely.</p>

<p>The number of Mohammed’s followers now increased
very fast; and ten years after his flight to Medina,
he returned to Mecca at the head of forty thousand
pilgrims. Soon all Arabia was converted to his faith,
and idolatry was no longer known in Mecca.</p>

<p>After Mohammed’s death, his followers formed the
plan of converting the whole world by means of the
sword. In course of time their armies overran Persia,
Egypt, and northern Africa. They also entered Spain,
and having established themselves there, they hoped
to conquer the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>Soon the Moslems, as the followers of Mohammed
were called, took possession of Palestine and of Jerusalem,
where was the sacred tomb of our Saviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>After the earliest churches had been established by
the apostles of Christ, it had been the custom of Christians
to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to see the tomb
of our Saviour. Each pilgrim carried a palm branch
and wore a cockleshell in his hat. The branch was the
token of victory; the shell a sign that the sea had been
crossed. After the Moslems had gained possession of
the Holy Land, as
Palestine is often
called, the pilgrims
often suffered
much from persecution.
Then, too,
they were required
to pay a large sum
for permission to
visit the tomb and
other sacred
places.</p>

<p>It was to free
the pilgrims, who
came from Europe,
from this persecution
that the crusades, or holy wars, were undertaken.
These crusades were begun through the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of one zealous man, a priest commonly known as
“Peter the Hermit.”</p>

<p>Peter the Hermit was born in France. He was in
turn a soldier, a priest, and a hermit. At length he
made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. On reaching
Jerusalem, he saw with such sadness the wrongs suffered
by the Christians that he said in his heart, “I will
rescue the tomb of our Lord from the heathen.”</p>

<p>During his stay in the Holy City, he went often to
the Church of the Resurrection. One day he beheld
in a vision the Lord, who directed him to go forth and
do his work. He at once returned to Europe. His
plan was to raise a great army and with it drive the
Moslems from the Holy Land. But he must first
obtain the consent and aid of Pope Urban II.</p>

<p>So he traveled to Rome and was permitted to tell
the Pope his plan. What a picture they made! The
Pope sat in state clothed in rich robes. His cardinals
and attendants were around him. Before him stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the pilgrim, his face tanned with exposure and his
clothes all travel-stained, telling of the grievous wrongs
suffered by the Christians in Jerusalem. No wonder
Pope Urban wept. The Pope gave his sanction to Peter
to preach throughout Europe, urging the people to
go and rescue the blessed tomb.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Peter the Hermit preaching the Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>Peter, light of heart but strong of purpose, started
forth in the year 1094. He was clad in a woolen garment
over which he wore a coarse brown mantle. His
feet and head he left bare. He was a small man, and
if you had seen him, you would not have called him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fine looking. Still, he was never refused admittance
into the presence of prince or king.</p>

<p>The poor loved him for his gentleness, and the rich
loaded him with gifts. These, however, he never kept
for himself, but gave to those who were in need.</p>

<p>At Clermont, in November, 1095, the Pope held a
council of all the cardinals, bishops, and priests who
stood high in the Church. He told them what Peter
meant to do, asking them to render him aid. So
earnestly did he speak, that when he had finished, they
all shouted together, “God wills it! God wills it!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Pope Urban, “let the army of the Lord
when it rushes upon its enemies shout that cry, ‘God
wills it.’”</p>

<p>He commanded all who should take up arms in the
cause to wear on the shoulder a cross, reminding them
that Christ had said, “He that does not take up his
cross and follow me is not worthy of me.” This is why
the wars were called the Crusades, for the word “crusade”
means literally “the taking of the cross.”</p>

<p>A great army was soon assembled and ready to march.
All the men were eager and wild with enthusiasm, but
most of them had never had any military training.
How would they succeed in that long and toilsome
journey across sea and land to Palestine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>They soon began to meet with trouble. In their
haste, they had not provided nearly enough food for
themselves. When that gave out, they began to take
whatever they needed from the people along the way.
In Hungary they did much harm to towns and farms.
This made the inhabitants very angry, and they came
out to fight the crusaders. Many of the crusaders were
killed and the rest were scattered in flight.</p>

<p>At length Peter was separated from his followers, and
wandered for some time alone in the forest. Then,
in order to make his whereabouts known to any who
might be in the same forest or near, he blew his horn.
In answer to his call several companies of his friends
soon appeared. So with only a small number of those
who at first started out, Peter at length reached Constantinople.</p>

<p>At that time Constantinople was the capital of the
Roman Empire in the East and its ruler was the Emperor
Alexis. The emperor received the crusaders
kindly. Here Peter the Hermit was rejoined by a
large force of his followers who had been separated
from him during the march.</p>

<p>After leaving Constantinople, the crusaders entered
the land of the Turks, through which they must march
before reaching the Holy Land. A terrible battle was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
soon fought with the Moslems, and most of the crusaders
perished. Peter now saw that with the few
men who were left he could do nothing; he therefore
decided to find a place of security among the mountains
and wait there until aid should come. There we shall
leave him for a time.</p>

<p>When Pope Urban II called the council of Clermont,
and so many men of all ranks stitched upon their
shoulders the cross of red silk, the Age of Chivalry in
Europe had already begun. The word “chivalry” is
from a French word which means rider of a horse.
So, when we speak of the Age of Chivalry, we picture
to ourselves knights riding their horses and engaging
in real or mock battles.</p>

<p>The mock battles were called jousts or tournaments,
and they were the chief amusement of the time. Noble
lords and beautiful ladies were present and watched
the contest from raised seats as we now watch ball
games. The real battles had many causes. Sometimes
one prince would quarrel with a neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
prince and settle the dispute by war. Sometimes a
body of knights would go forth to avenge a wrong.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Knight of the Crusades</span></p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a king would call upon
his knights to go with him to conquer
some neighboring country.
The knights were therefore always
ready for war.</p>

<p>Every boy, if he were the son
of a noble, at about the age of
seven was sent to the
castle or court of some
prince or king, as a page.</p>

<p>Here he was taught
modesty and obedience,
hunting, riding,
archery, and the
hurling of the lance.</p>

<p>When he had become
skillful in these
he might bear the
shield of his master.
He was then a squire. He must know no fear, and
must not boast of his own deeds. He must defend the
weak and be ever courteous to ladies. At feasts he
must carve the meats and wait upon the guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>When he reached the age of twenty-one, the squire
might be made a knight. This was often a very pretty
ceremony. The squire would come before his lord and
a great party of nobles, dressed in armor, except the
helmet, sword, and spurs.</p>

<p>Several nobles would offer themselves as sponsors,
declaring that they were sure he would prove himself
noble and brave. Then the squire was struck lightly
on the shoulders with the sword of his master. At the
same time his master repeated these words, “I dub
thee knight in the name of God and St. Michael; be
faithful, bold, and fortunate.” The knight then went
forth to do some deed by which to “win his spurs.”</p>

<p>Sometimes, before being knighted, the young squire
was left in the chapel of the castle all night. Here he
guarded his armor, and by devout and continuous
prayer invoked the blessing of God upon himself and
whatever cause he should undertake.</p>

<p>Urged by the preaching of Peter the Hermit and the
encouragement of Pope Urban, the knights of Western
Europe took up the cause of the crusades. Soon after
the departure of Peter with his untrained host of
followers, a gallant army, led by two famous knights,
Godfrey of Bouillon and Tancred, an Italian knight,
began its march to the Holy Land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter at last succeeded in joining them with the few
men who were left with him, and together they advanced
to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Many are the tales that are told of the knightly
leaders in this first crusade, and many were their
adventures. It was on the 29th of May, 1099, that the
Christian army first came into full view of the Holy
City. Filled with new zeal at the sight, every man
shouted, “It is the will of God.”</p>

<p>The city, however, had been fortified in every
possible way, and Godfrey, who was in command,
knew it would be a hard task to mount the high walls.
He was certain that battering-rams would be necessary
to break down the walls, but how were they to obtain
the material to make them? The barren country
around afforded nothing of which they could make use.
To transport the timber from a distance would exhaust
both men and horses which were already suffering
from scarcity of water and food.</p>

<p>At last news came that a fleet had arrived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Genoa with siege machines and supplies. The crusaders
hastened to the nearest seaport, but found that
their enemies had been before them and destroyed
the fleet. Still they were able to pick up much of the
material and many of the instruments used in the
making of the machines. Some of the Genoese who
were skilled in handicraft put together a few wooden
towers and other devices which were of great use in
surmounting and breaking down the walls. Bridges
were also thrown out, over the walls, by which the
soldiers could pass into the city.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, July 14, 1099, the crusaders
made the first attack with their wooden towers. The
Saracens, as the Mohammedans were called by the
crusaders, met them with missiles of all sorts, which
they threw upon them. The crusaders soon made a
breach in the wall, but still could not enter the city.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the attack was renewed.
A procession of priests was formed and moved about
through the throng, encouraging the knights. A pigeon
was captured, and under its wing a note was found
telling the Saracen commander that help was at hand.
This stirred the Christians to still fiercer attack.</p>

<p>Suddenly there appeared to the host a horseman
clothed in white. The crusaders at once recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the vision of St. George. “St. George has come to
our assistance,” Godfrey exclaimed. “He signals to
enter the Holy City.”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jerusalem taken by the Crusaders</span></p>
</div>

<p>Again arose the cry, “God wills it! God wills it!”
Godfrey commanded the attack to be renewed. The
hay which the Saracens had heaped up against the
walls to deaden the shock of the battering-rams was
set on fire. The Saracens, stifled by the smoke, leaped
from the walls. Then the tower bridges were let fall,
and soon Godfrey and other knights forced their way
into the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of the Holy City, Godfrey was
chosen king of Jerusalem, or Defender of the Faith.
But he lived only about a year to enjoy that high
distinction.</p>

<p>Tancred was known among his followers for his unselfishness.
He seemed never to become weary. If a
comrade complained of a duty, he himself would perform
it. He patrolled walls at night, fought by day,
and by his own endurance of labor and hard fare
sought to set an example for his men.</p>

<p>One night, when he was standing guard with only
his squire as companion, he was attacked by three
armed Saracens on horseback. They came upon him
quickly, thinking, of course, that they could easily
overcome him. They did not know that the blade of
this renowned warrior could cleave their heavy armor
as if it were cloth.</p>

<p>On came the first horseman and down came Tancred’s
sword. The Saracen fell. The next, who had
seen the first one fall, waited for the third. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cautiously they approached side by side, but they
soon fared the same as their companion.</p>

<p>It was Tancred who took possession of Bethlehem.
He was made ruler over that part of the Holy Land,
but hearing that Antioch was threatened by the Saracens,
he went to its relief. For three years he held it
against the unbelievers.</p>

<p>Tancred’s cousin, Bohemond, who was the rightful
ruler of Antioch, was held as prisoner by the Saracen
commander; but finally Tancred succeeded in setting
his cousin free. He at once gave up to his cousin the
entire rule, although he had so endeared himself to the
people that they besought him to remain.</p>

<p>A battle wound was the cause of Tancred’s death.
He met his fate bravely, and died with the purpose of
saving the Holy Land still uppermost in his heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Between the years 1095 and 1270 there were eight
crusades, all undertaken for the purpose of delivering
the Holy Land from the Saracens. While they failed to
accomplish that object, they were still of great benefit
to the Church and civilization. They made the people
better acquainted with the geography and history of
other lands, and led to an increase of trade and industry
throughout the known world.</p>

<p>One day when St. Francis was in a village of Italy,
he began to preach; and first of all he commanded
the swallows who were singing that they should keep
silence until he had done preaching, and the swallows
obeyed him. And he preached with so much fervor
that all the men and women in that village were
minded to go forth and abandon the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>But St. Francis suffered them not, and said to them:
“Do not be in haste, and do not go hence, and I will
order that which you must do for the salvation of your
souls;” and then he thought of his third order for the
salvation of the whole world. And he left them much
comforted and well disposed to penance; and he departed
thence.</p>

<p>And passing along, in fervor of soul, he lifted up his
eyes and saw many trees standing by the way, and filled
with a countless multitude of little birds; at which
St. Francis wondered, and said to his companions,
“Wait a little for me in the road, and I will go and
preach to my sisters the birds.”</p>

<p>And he entered into the field, and began to preach to
the birds that were on the ground. And suddenly,
those that were in the trees came around him, and
together they all remained silent, so long as it pleased
St. Francis to speak; and even after he had finished
they would not depart until he had given them his
blessing. And according as it was afterwards related,
St. Francis went among them and touched them with
his cloak, and none of them moved.</p>

<p>The substance of the sermon was this: “My little
sisters, the birds, you are much beholden to God your
creator, and in all places you ought to praise Him, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
He has given you liberty to fly about in all
places, and has given you double and triple raiment.
Know also that He preserved your race in the ark of
Noe that your species might not perish.</p>

<p>“And again you are beholden to Him for the element
of air, which He has appointed for you; and for this
also that you never sow nor reap, but God feeds you
and gives you the brooks and fountains for your drink,
the mountains and valleys also for your refuge, and the
tall trees wherein to make your nests. And since you
know neither how to sew nor how to spin, God clothes
you, you and your young ones. Wherefore your creator
loves you much, since He has bestowed on you so many
benefits. And therefore beware, my little sisters, of
the sin of ingratitude, and study always to please God.”</p>

<p>As St. Francis spoke thus to them, all the multitude
of these birds opened their beaks, and stretched out
their necks, and opened their wings; and reverently
bowing their heads to the earth, by their acts and by
their songs they showed that the words of the holy
father gave them the greatest delight. And St. Francis
rejoiced, and was glad with them, and marveled much
at such a multitude of birds, and at their beautiful
variety, and their attention and familiarity; for all
which he devoutly praised their creator in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, having finished his sermon, St. Francis
made the sign of the cross over them, and gave them
leave to depart. Thereupon, all those birds arose in
the air, with wonderful singing; and after the fashion
of the sign of the cross which St. Francis had made
over them, they divided themselves into four parts;
and one part flew toward the east, and another to
the west, another to the south, and another to the
north.</p>

<p>Then, all departing, they went their way singing
wonderful songs, signifying by this that as St. Francis,
standard bearer of the cross of Christ, had preached to
them, made on them the sign of the cross, after which
they had divided themselves, going to the four parts
of the world, so the preaching of the cross of Christ,
renewed by St. Francis, should be carried by him and
by his brothers to the whole world, and that these
brothers, after the fashion of the birds, should possess
nothing of their own in this world, but commit their
lives solely to the providence of God.</p>

<p>How surely the birds know their enemies! See
how the wrens and robins and bluebirds pursue and
scold the cat, while they take little or no notice of the
dog! Even the swallow will fight the cat, and, relying
too confidently upon its powers of flight, sometimes
swoops down so near to its enemy that it is caught
by a sudden stroke of the cat’s paw. The only case I
know of in which our small birds fail to recognize their
enemy is furnished by the shrike; apparently the little
birds do not know that this modest-colored bird is an
assassin. At least, I have never seen them scold or
molest him, or utter any outcries at his presence, as
they usually do at birds of prey.</p>

<p>But the birds have nearly all found out the trick
of the jay, and when he comes sneaking through the
trees in May and June in quest of eggs, he is quickly
exposed and roundly abused. It is amusing to see
the robins hustle him out of the tree which holds their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
nest. They cry, “Thief! thief!” to the top of their
voices as they charge upon him, and the jay retorts
in a voice scarcely less complimentary as he makes
off.</p>

<p>The jays have their enemies also, and need to keep
an eye on their own eggs. It would be interesting to
know if jays ever rob jays,
or crows plunder crows;
or is there honor among
thieves even in the feathered
tribes? I suspect the
jay is often punished by
birds which are otherwise
innocent of nest robbing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="A jay. Illustrator credit: GLEESON." />
</div>

<p>One season I found a
jay’s nest in a cedar on
the side of a wooded ridge.
It held five eggs, every one
of which had been punctured.
Apparently some
bird had driven its sharp
beak through their shells,
with the sole intention of destroying them, for no part
of the contents of the eggs had been removed. It
looked like a case of revenge&mdash;as if some thrush or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
warbler, whose nest had suffered at the hands of the
jays, had watched its opportunity, and had in this way
retaliated upon its enemies. An egg for an egg. The
jays were lingering near, very demure and silent, and
probably ready to join a crusade against nest robbers.</p>

<p>The great bugaboo of the birds is the owl. The
owl snatches them from off their roosts at night, and
gobbles up their eggs and young in their nests. He
is a veritable ogre to them, and his presence fills them
with consternation and alarm.</p>

<p>One season, to protect my early cherries, I placed
a large stuffed owl amid the branches of the tree.
Such a racket as there instantly began about my
grounds is not pleasant to think upon. The orioles
and robins fairly “shrieked out their affright.” The
news instantly spread in every direction, and apparently
every bird in town came to see that owl in the cherry
tree, and every bird took a cherry, so that I lost more
fruit than if I had left the owl indoors. With craning
necks and horrified looks the birds alighted upon the
branches, and between their screams would snatch off
a cherry, as if the act was some relief to their feelings.</p>

<p>The chirp and chatter of the young of birds which
build in concealed or inclosed places, like the woodpeckers,
the house wren, the high-hoe, the oriole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
etc., is in marked contrast to the silence of the fledgelings
of most birds that build open and exposed nests.
The young of the sparrows, warblers, flycatchers,
thrushes, etc., never allow a sound to escape them; and
on the alarm note of their parents being heard, sit
especially close and motionless, while the young of
chimney swallows, woodpeckers, and orioles are very
noisy.</p>

<p>The owl, I suspect, thrusts its leg into the cavities
of woodpeckers and into the pocket-like nest of the
oriole, and clutches and brings forth the birds in its
talons. In one case, a screech owl had thrust its claw
into a cavity in a tree, and grasped the head of a red-headed
woodpecker; being apparently unable to draw
its prey forth, it had thrust its own round head into
the hole, and in some way became fixed there, and had
thus died with the woodpecker in its talons.</p>

<p>The life of birds is beset with dangers and mishaps
of which we know little. One day, in my walk, I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
upon a goldfinch with the tip of one wing securely fastened
to the feathers of its back, by what appeared
to be the silk of some caterpillar. The bird, though
uninjured, was completely crippled, and could not fly
a stroke. Its little body was hot and panting in my
hands as I carefully broke the fetter. Then it darted
swiftly away with a happy cry.</p>

<p>A record of all the accidents and tragedies of bird
life for a single season would show many curious incidents.
A friend of mine opened his box stove one fall
to kindle a fire in it, when he beheld in the black interior
the desiccated forms of two bluebirds. The
birds had probably taken refuge in the chimney during
some cold spring storm, and had come down the pipe
to the stove, from whence they were unable to ascend.</p>

<p>A peculiarly touching little incident of bird life occurred
to a caged canary. It laid some eggs, and was
so carried away by its feelings that it would offer food
to the eggs, and chatter and twitter, trying, as it
seemed, to encourage them to eat. The incident is
hardly tragic, neither is it comic.</p>

<p>Certain birds nest in the vicinity of our houses and
outbuildings, or even in and upon them, for protection
from their enemies, but they often thus expose themselves
to plague of the most deadly character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>I refer to the vermin with which their nests often
swarm, and which kill the young before they are fledged.
In a state of nature this probably never happens;
at least I have never seen or heard of it happening
to nests placed in trees or under rocks. It is the curse
of civilization falling upon the birds which come too
near man. The vermin is probably conveyed to the
nest in hen’s feathers, or in straws and hairs picked
up about the barn or henhouse. A robin’s nest will
occasionally become an intolerable nuisance from the
swarms upon swarms of minute vermin with which it
is filled. The parent birds stem the tide as long as
they can, but are often compelled to leave the young
to their terrible fate.</p>

<p>One season a phœbe bird built on a projecting stone
under the eaves of the house, and all appeared to go
well till the young were nearly fledged, when the nest
suddenly became a bit of purgatory. The birds kept
their places till they could hold out no longer, when
they leaped forth and fell dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>After a delay of a week or more, during which I
imagine the parent birds purified themselves by every
means known to them, the couple built another nest
a few yards from the first, and proceeded to rear a
second brood; but the new nest developed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
same bed of torment that the first did, and the three
young birds, nearly ready to fly, perished as they sat
within it. The parent birds then left the place.</p>

<p>I imagine the smaller birds have an enemy in our
native white-footed mouse, though I have not proof
enough to convict him. But one season the nest of a
chickadee which I was observing was broken up in a
position where nothing but a mouse could have reached
it. The bird had chosen a cavity in the limb of an
apple tree which stood but a few yards from the house.
The cavity was deep, and the entrance to it, which was
ten feet from the ground, was small.</p>

<p>Barely light enough was admitted to enable one to
make out the number of eggs, which was six, at the
bottom of the dim interior. While one was peering in
and trying to get his head out of his own light, the
bird would startle him by a queer kind of puffing
sound. She would not leave her nest like most birds,
but really tried to blow, or scare, the intruder away;
and after repeated experiments I could hardly refrain
from jerking my head back when that little explosion
of sound came up from the dark interior.</p>

<p>One night the nest was harried. A slight trace of
hair or fur at the entrance led me to infer that some
small animal was the robber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>A weasel might have done it, as they sometimes
climb trees, but I doubt if either a squirrel or a rat
could have passed the entrance.</p>

<p>A pair of the least flycatchers, the bird which is a
small edition of the pewee, one season built their nest
where I had them for many hours each day under my
observation. The nest was a very snug and compact
structure placed in the forks of a small maple about
twelve feet from the ground. The season before a red
squirrel had harried the nest of a wood thrush in this
same tree, and I was apprehensive that he would serve
the flycatchers the same trick; so, as I sat with my
book in a summerhouse near by, I kept my loaded gun
within easy reach.</p>

<p>One egg was laid, and the next morning, as I made
my daily inspection of the nest, only a fragment of its
empty shell was to be found. This I removed, mentally
imprecating the rogue of a red squirrel. The
birds were much disturbed by the event, but after
much inspection of it and many consultations together,
concluded, it seems, to try again.</p>

<p>Two more eggs were laid, when one day I heard the
birds utter a sharp cry, and on looking up I saw a cat-bird
perched upon the rim of the nest, hastily devouring
the eggs. I soon regretted my precipitation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
killing her, because such interference is generally unwise.
It turned out that she had a nest of her own
with five eggs in a spruce tree near my window.</p>

<p>Then this pair of little flycatchers did what I had
never seen birds do before: they pulled the nest to
pieces and rebuilt it in a peach tree not many rods
away, where a brood was successfully reared. The
nest was here exposed to the direct rays of the noonday
sun, and to shield her young when the heat was greatest,
the mother-bird would stand above them with wings
slightly spread, as other birds have been known to do
under like circumstances.</p>

<p>Probably the darkest tragedy of the nest is enacted
when a snake plunders it. All birds and animals, so
far as I have observed, behave in a peculiar manner
toward a snake. They seem to feel something of the
same loathing toward it that the human species experience.
The bark of a dog when he encounters a
snake is different from that which he gives out on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
other occasion; it is a mingled note of alarm, inquiry,
and disgust.</p>

<p>One day a tragedy was enacted a few yards from
where I was sitting with a book: two song sparrows
were trying to defend their nest against a black snake.
The curious, interrogating note of a chicken who had
suddenly come upon the scene in his walk first caused
me to look up from my reading. There were the sparrows,
with wings raised in a way peculiarly expressive
of horror and dismay, rushing about a low clump of
grass and bushes.</p>

<p>Then, looking more closely, I saw the glistening form
of the black snake, and the quick movement of his
head as he tried to seize the birds. The sparrows
darted about and through the grass and weeds, trying
to beat the snake off. Their tails and wings were
spread, and, panting with the heat and desperate
struggle, they presented a most singular spectacle.
They uttered no cry, not a sound escaped them; they
were plainly speechless with horror and dismay. Not
once did they drop their wings, and the peculiar expression
of those uplifted palms, as it were, I shall
never forget.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that perhaps here was a case of
attempted bird charming on the part of the snake, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I looked on from behind the fence. The birds charged
the snake and harassed him from every side, but were
evidently under no spell save that of courage in defending
their nest.</p>

<p>Every moment or two I could see the head and neck
of the serpent make a sweep at the birds, when the one
struck at would fall back, and the other would renew
the assault. There appeared to be little danger that
the snake could strike and hold one of the birds,
though I trembled for them, they were so bold and approached
so near to the snake’s head. Time and again
he sprang at them but without success. How the poor
things panted, and held up their wings appealingly!</p>

<p>Then the snake glided off, barely escaping the stone
which I hurled at him. I found the nest rifled and
deranged; whether it had contained eggs or young I
know not. The male sparrow had cheered me many a
day with his song, and I blamed myself for not having
rushed at once to the rescue, when the arch enemy
was upon him.</p>

<p>There is probably little truth in the popular notion
that snakes charm birds. The black snake is the most
subtle of our snakes, and I have never seen him have
any but young, helpless birds in his mouth.</p>

<p>I will now tell you a story of King Robert Bruce
during his wanderings. His adventures are as entertaining
as those which men invent for story books,
with this advantage, that they are all true.</p>

<p>About the time when the Bruce was yet at the
head of but few men, Sir Aymer de Valence, who was
Earl of Pembroke, together with John of Lorn, came
into Galloway, each of them being at the head of a
large body of men.</p>

<p>John of Lorn had a bloodhound with him, which it
was said had formerly belonged to Robert Bruce himself;
and having been fed by the king with his own
hands, it became attached to him and would follow
his footsteps anywhere, as dogs are well known to
trace their masters’ steps, whether they be bloodhounds
or not. By means of this hound, John of Lorn
thought he should certainly find out Bruce, and take
revenge on him for the death of his relation Comyn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>When these two armies advanced upon King Robert,
he at first thought of fighting the English earl; but
becoming aware that John of Lorn was moving round
with another large body to attack him in the rear, he
resolved to avoid fighting at that time, lest he should
be oppressed by numbers. For this purpose, the king
divided the men he had with him into three bodies,
and commanded them to retreat by three different
ways, thinking the enemy would not know which party
to pursue. He also appointed a place at which they
were to assemble again.</p>

<p>When John of Lorn came to the place where the
army of Bruce had been thus divided, the bloodhound
took his course after one of these divisions, neglecting
the other two, and then John of Lorn knew that the
king must be in that party; so he also made no pursuit
after the two other divisions, but, with all his
men, followed that which the dog pointed out.</p>

<p>The king again saw that he was followed by a
large body, and being determined to escape from them
if possible, he made all the people who were with him
disperse themselves different ways, thinking thus that
the enemy must needs lose trace of him. He kept
only one man along with him, and that was his own
foster brother, or the son of his nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>When John of Lorn came to the place where Bruce’s
companions had dispersed themselves, the bloodhound,
after it had snuffed up and down for a little, quitted
the footsteps of all the other fugitives, and ran barking
upon the track of two men out of the whole number.
Then John of Lorn knew that one of these two
must be King Robert. Accordingly, he commanded
five of his men to chase after him, and either make
him prisoner or slay him.</p>

<p>The Highlanders started off accordingly, and ran so
fast that they gained sight of Robert and his foster
brother. The king asked his companion what help he
could give him, and his foster brother answered he was
ready to do his best. So these two turned on the five
men of John of Lorn and killed them all.</p>

<p>By this time Bruce was very much fatigued, and
yet they dared not sit down to take any rest; for
whenever they stopped for an instant, they heard the
cry of the bloodhound behind them, and knew by that
that their enemies were coming up fast after them.
At length they came to a wood through which ran
a small river. Then Bruce said to his foster brother,
“Let us wade down this stream for a great way, instead
of going straight across, and so this unhappy
hound will lose the scent; for if we were once clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of him, I should not be afraid of getting away from
the pursuers.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the king and his attendant walked a
great way down the stream, taking care to keep their
feet in the water, which could not retain any scent
where they had stepped. Then they came ashore on
the farther side from the enemy, and went deep into
the wood.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the hound led John of Lorn
straight to the place where the king went into the
water, but there the dog began to be puzzled, not
knowing where to go next; for running water cannot
retain the scent of a man’s foot, like that which
remains on turf. So John of Lorn, seeing the dog was
at fault, as it is called, that is, had lost the track of
that which he pursued, he gave up the chase and returned
to join with Aymer de Valence.</p>

<p>King Robert’s adventures were not yet ended. His
foster brother and he walked on in hopes of coming to
some habitation. At length, in the midst of the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
they met with three men who looked like thieves or
ruffians. They were well armed, and one of them bore
a sheep on his back, which it seemed as if they had
just stolen.</p>

<p>They saluted the king civilly; and he, replying to
their salutations, asked them where they were going.
The men answered they were seeking for Robert Bruce,
for that they intended to join with him.</p>

<p>The king answered that he would conduct them
where they would find the Scottish king. Then the
man who had spoken changed countenance, and
Bruce, who looked sharply at him, began to suspect
that the ruffian guessed who he was, and that he and
his companions had some design against his person,
in order to gain the reward which had been offered
for his life.</p>

<p>So he said to them, “My good friends, as we are not
well acquainted with each other, you must go before
us, and we will follow near to you.”</p>

<p>“You have no occasion to suspect any harm from
us,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“Neither do I suspect any,” said Bruce; “but this
is the way in which I choose to travel.”</p>

<p>The men did as he commanded, and thus they
traveled till they came together to a waste and ruinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
cottage, where the men proposed to dress some part
of the sheep, which their companion was carrying.
The king was glad to hear of food; but he insisted
that there should be two fires kindled,&mdash;one for himself
and his foster brother at one end of the house, the
other at the other end for their three companions.</p>

<p>The men did as he desired. They broiled a quarter
of mutton for themselves, and gave another to the king
and his attendant. They were obliged to eat it without
bread or salt; but as they were very hungry, they
were glad to get food in any shape, and partook of it
very heartily.</p>

<p>Then so heavy a drowsiness fell on King Robert,
that, for all the danger he was in, he could not resist
an inclination to sleep. But first he desired his foster
brother to watch while he slept, for he had great suspicion
of their new acquaintances. His foster brother
promised to keep awake, and did his best to keep his
word. But the king had not been long asleep ere his
foster brother fell into a deep slumber also, for he had
undergone as much fatigue as the king.</p>

<p>When the three villains saw the king and his attendant
asleep they made signs to each other, and, rising
up at once, drew their swords with the purpose to kill
them both. But the king slept lightly, and for as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
noise as the traitors made, he was awakened by it, and
starting up, drew his sword and went to meet them.
At the same moment he pushed his foster brother with
his foot to awaken him, and he got on his feet; but
ere he had got his eyes cleared to see what was about
to happen, one of the ruffians slew him.</p>

<p>The king was now alone, one man against three,
and in the greatest danger of his life; but his amazing
strength, and the good armor which he wore, freed
him from this great peril, and he killed the three men,
one after another. He then left the cottage, very
sorrowful for the death of his faithful foster brother,
and took his direction toward the place where he had
appointed his men to assemble.</p>

<p>It was now near night, and the place of meeting
being a farmhouse, Bruce went boldly into it, where he
found the mistress, an old, true-hearted Scotswoman,
sitting alone. Upon seeing a stranger enter, she asked
him who he was. The king answered that he was a
traveler, who was journeying through the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“All travelers,” answered the good woman, “are
welcome here for the sake of one.”</p>

<p>“And who is that one,” said the king, “for whose
sake you make all travelers welcome?”</p>

<p>“It is our rightful king, Robert the Bruce,” answered
the mistress, “who is the lawful lord of this country;
and although he is now pursued with hounds and horns,
I hope to live to see him king over all Scotland.”</p>

<p>“Since you love him so well, dame,” said the king,
“know that you see him before you. I am Robert the
Bruce.”</p>

<p>“You!” said the good woman, “and wherefore
are you thus alone?&mdash;where are all your men?”</p>

<p>“I have none with me at this moment,” answered
Bruce, “and therefore I must travel alone.”</p>

<p>“But that shall not be,” said the brave old
dame; “for I have two sons, gallant and trusty
men, who shall be your servants for life and death.”</p>

<p>So she brought her two sons, and though she well
knew the dangers to which she exposed them, she
made them swear fidelity to the king; and they
afterward became high officers in his service.</p>

<p>Now the loyal old woman was getting everything
ready for the king’s supper, when suddenly there was
a great trampling of horses heard round the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
They thought it must be some of the English, or John
of Lorn’s men, and the good wife called upon her sons
to fight to the last for King Robert. But shortly after
they heard the voice of the good Lord James of Douglas,
and of Edward Bruce, the king’s brother, who
had come with a hundred and fifty horsemen to this
farmhouse.</p>

<p>Robert the Bruce, forgetting hunger and weariness,
began to inquire where the enemy who had
pursued them so long had taken up their abode
for the night; “for,” said he, “as they must suppose
us totally scattered and fled, it is likely that they
will think themselves quite secure, and keep careless
watch.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” answered James of Douglas,
“for I passed a village where there are two hundred
of them quartered, who had placed no sentinels; and
if you have a mind, we may surprise them, and do
them more mischief than they have done us.”</p>

<p>Then there was nothing but mount and ride; and
as the Scots came by surprise on the body of English
whom Douglas had mentioned, and rushed suddenly
into the village where they were quartered, they easily
dispersed and cut them to pieces.</p>

</div>

<p>There is perhaps no other animal in the world so
useful as the reindeer, at least none that can be put
to so many uses. The flesh of a sheep is eaten, and
its wool is woven into cloth; but then we should never
think of harnessing a sheep even to a baby carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
A camel serves, in the desert, the purpose of a van
and of a riding horse in one, and his hair makes warm
garments; but he would give us a very ill-tasting
dinner, and the same may be said of some other useful
creatures. A reindeer, however, is good to eat, and
makes an excellent steed; its milk is nourishing; the
softer parts of its horns, when properly prepared, are
considered a delicacy; the bones are turned to account
as tools; the sinews are twisted into thread, and, all
the long winter, the skin and hair keep the dwellers
in the far North snug and warm. Take away the reindeer,
and the inhabitants of every country north of
latitude 60° would feel as helpless as we should in
England if there were no more sheep or cows!</p>

<p>Reindeer live, by choice, on the slopes of mountains,
and require no better food than the moss, or little
alpine plants, which they find growing in the crevices
of the rock. Sometimes, in very cold places, or when
the winter is particularly severe, they take shelter in
the forest; but when spring is in the air once more,
out they come in great herds, thin and sore from the
bites of newly awakened insects, and wander away in
search of fresher pasture. In August and September,
when the sun has grown too strong for them, they seek
the shade of the woods again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>In their wild state reindeer are great travelers, and
as they are very strong, and excellent swimmers, they
go immense distances, especially the reindeer of North
America, who will cross the ice to Greenland in the
early part of the year, and stay there till the end of
October, when they come back to their old quarters.
They are most sociable creatures, and are never happy
unless they have three or four hundred companions,
while herds of a thousand have sometimes been counted.
The females and calves are always placed in front,
and the big bucks bring up the rear, to see that nobody
falls out of the ranks from weakness.</p>

<p>Like many animals that live in the North, the color
of the reindeer is different in winter from what it is
in summer. Twice a year he changes his coat, and
the immense thick covering which has been so comfortable
all through the fierce cold, begins to fall in
early spring and a short hair to take its place, so that
by the time summer comes, he is nice and cool, and
looks quite another creature from what he did in the
winter. As the days shorten and grow frosty, the coat
becomes longer and closer, and by the time the first
snow falls the deer is quite prepared to meet it.</p>

<p>Though reindeer prefer mountain sides when they
can get them, their broad and wide-cleft hoofs are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
adapted for the lowlands of the North of Europe and
of America, which are a morass in summer and a snow-field
in winter. Here are to be seen whole herds of
them, either walking with a regular rapid step, or else
going at a quick trot; but in either case always making
a peculiar crackling noise with their feet.</p>

<p>They have an acute sense of smell, and will detect
a man at a distance of five or six hundred paces, and
as their eyes are as good as their ears, the huntsman
has much ado to get up to them. They are dainty in
their food, choosing out only the most delicate of the
alpine plants, and their skins cannot be as tough as
they look, for they are very sensitive to the bites of
mosquitoes, gnats, and particularly of midges.</p>

<p>Reindeer are very cautious, as many hunters have
found to their cost; but they are ready to be friendly
with any cows or horses they may come across, and
this must make the task of taming them a great
deal easier. They have their regular hours for meals,
too, and early in the mornings and late in the evenings
may be seen going out for their breakfasts and
suppers, which, in summer, consist, in the highlands,
of the leaves and flowers of the snow ranunculus,
reindeer sorrel, a favorite kind of grass, and, better
than all, the young shoots of the dwarf birch. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the afternoons they lie down and rest, and choose for
their place of repose a patch of snow, or a glacier if
one is at hand.</p>

<p>In Norway and Lapland great herds of reindeer may
be seen, during the summer, wandering along the banks
of rivers, or making for the mountains, returning with
the approach of winter to their old quarters. With the
first snow fall they are safe under shelter, for this is
the time when wolves are most to be feared. In the
spring they are let loose again, and are driven carefully
to some spot which is freer from midges than the rest.
And so life goes on from year to year.</p>

<p>Reindeer herding is by no means so easy as it looks,
and it would be quite impossible, even to a Lapp, if
it were not for the help of dogs, who are part of the
family. They are small creatures, hardly as big as a
Spitz, and very thin, with close compact hair all over
their bodies. These dogs are very obedient, and
understand every movement of their master’s eyelid.
They will not only keep the herd together on land, but
follow them into a river, or across an arm of the sea.
It is they who rescue the weaklings in danger of drowning,
after their winter’s fast, and in the autumn, when
the reindeer have grown strong from good living, drive
the herd back again through the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>A herd of reindeer on the march is a beautiful sight
to see. They go quickly along, faster than any other
domestic animal, and are kept together by the herdsman
and his dogs, who are untiring in their efforts to
bring up stragglers.</p>

<p>When a good stretch of pasture is found, the Lapps
build a fold, into which the reindeer are driven every
evening, so that the work of the milkers may be lightened.
These folds are made of the stems of birches
placed close together and strengthened with cross-pieces
and strong props. They are about seven feet
high, and have two wide doors. At milking time,
which the dogs know as well as the men, the animals
are driven inside by their faithful guardians, and
milking begins busily. The young ones are generally
left outside under the watchful eyes of the dogs, who
see that they do not wander too far away.</p>

<p>Inside the fold the noise is really deafening. The
reindeer run to and fro, giving loud cries and throwing
their heads about; which, as their horns are very big,
is not pleasant for the milkers. Any one walking that
way would be struck, first, with the sound of the commotion
in the inclosure, and this would most likely
be followed by a crackling noise, as if a hundred
electric batteries were at work at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of the fold are thick tree trunks to
which the reindeer which have to be milked are fastened,
for without these they would not stand still
one single instant.</p>

<p>The milkers have a thong which is thrown round the
neck of the animal, and drawn closer till it is tied by
a slip noose over the creature’s mouth, so as to prevent
it from biting. Then the ends are made secure to the
milking block, and the milking begins&mdash;the animal
all the while struggling hard to get free. But the
Lapps know how to manage them, and only draw the
cord tighter over the nose, so that the creatures are
bound in self-defense to remain quiet.</p>

<p>The milk flows into a sort of large bowl with handles,
but the Lapps are both careless and dirty in their ways,
and not only waste a great deal of the milk, but leave so
many hairs in it that it is necessary to strain it through
a cloth before it can be drunk. However, the milk
itself is very good. The milking once over, the doors
are opened, and the animals scamper out joyously.</p>

<p>All together, the life of the owner of a herd of reindeer
cannot be said to be an idle one. Yet he is
in general well satisfied with his lot, and thinks himself
the most fortunate man in the world.</p>

<p>There was a great smith in Ulster of the name of
Culain, who made a feast for Conchubar and his people.
When Conchubar was setting out to the feast, he
passed by the lawn where the boy troop were at their
games, and he watched them awhile, and saw how
young Setanta, his sister’s son, was winning the goal
from them all.</p>

<p>“That little lad will serve Ulster yet,” said Conchubar;
“and call him to me now,” he said, “and let him
come with me to the smith’s feast.”</p>

<p>“I cannot go with you now,” said Setanta, when
they had called to him, “for these boys have not had
enough of play yet.”</p>

<p>“It would be too long for me to wait for you,”
said the king.</p>

<p>“There is no need for you to wait; I will follow the
track of the chariots,” said Setanta.</p>

<p>So Conchubar went on to the smith’s house, and there
was a welcome before him, and the feast was brought
in, and they began to be merry. And then Culain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
said to the king, “Will there be any one else of your
people coming after you to-night?”</p>

<p>“There will not,” said Conchubar, for he forgot
that he had told the little lad to follow him. “But
why do you ask me that?” he said.</p>

<p>“I have a fierce hound,” said the smith, “and when
I take the chain off him, he lets no one come into the
district with himself, and he will obey no one but
myself, and he has in him the strength of a hundred.”</p>

<p>“Loose him out,” said Conchubar, “and let him
keep a watch on the place.”</p>

<p>So Culain loosed him out, and the dog made a course
round the whole district, and then he came back to
the place where he was used to watch the house.</p>

<p>Now, as to the boys at Emain, when they were done
playing, every one went to his father’s house, or to
whoever was in charge of him. But Setanta set out on
the track of the chariots, shortening the way for himself
with his hurling stick and his ball.</p>

<p>When he came to the lawn before the smith’s
house, the hound heard him coming, and began such a
fierce yelling that he might have been heard through
all Ulster, and he sprang at him as if he had a mind not
to stop and tear him up at all, but to swallow him at
the one mouthful. The little fellow had no weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but his stick and his ball, but when he saw the hound
coming at him, he struck the ball with such force that
it went down his throat, and through his body. Then
he seized him by the hind legs and dashed him against
a rock until there was no life left in him.</p>

<p>When the men feasting within heard the outcry of
the hound, Conchubar started up and said, “It is no
good luck brought us on this journey, for that is surely
my sister’s son that was coming after me, and that has
got his death by the hound.”</p>

<p>On that all the men rushed out, not waiting to go
through the door, but over walls and barriers as they
could. But Fergus was the first to get to where the
boy was, and he took him up and lifted him on his
shoulder, and brought him in safe and sound to Conchubar,
and there was great joy in them all.</p>

<p>But Culain the smith went out with them, and when
he saw his great hound lying dead and broken, there
was great grief in his heart, and he came in and said to
Setanta, “There is no good welcome for you here.”</p>

<p>“What have you against the little lad?” said Conchubar.</p>

<p>“It was no good luck that brought him here, or that
made me prepare this feast for yourself,” said the smith,
“for now, my hound being gone, my substance will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
wasted, and my way of living will be gone astray.
And, little boy,” he said, “that was a good member
of my family you took from me, for he was the protector
of my flocks and of all that I have.”</p>

<p>“Do not be vexed on account of that,” said the boy,
“and I myself will makeup to you for what I have done.”</p>

<p>“How will you do that?” said Conchubar.</p>

<p>“This is how I will do it: if there is a whelp of the
same breed to be had in Ireland, I will rear him and
train him until he is as good a hound as the one killed;
and until that time, Culain,” he said, “I myself will
be your watchdog, to guard your goods and your
cattle and your house.”</p>

<p>“You have made a fair offer,” said Conchubar.</p>

<p>“I could have given no better award myself,” said
Cathbad the Druid. “And from this out,” he said,
“your name will be Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain.”</p>

<p>“I am better pleased with my own name of Setanta,”
said the boy.</p>

<p>“Do not say that,” said Cathbad, “for all the men
in the whole world will some day have the name of
Cuchulain in their mouths.”</p>

<p>“If that is so, I am content to keep it,” said the
boy. And this is how he came by the name Cuchulain.</p>

<p>There are a great many interesting stories about
the first settlement of San Gabriel, and the habits
and customs of the Indians there. They were a very
polite people to each other, and used to train their
children in some respects very carefully.</p>

<p>If a child were sent to bring water to an older
person, and he tasted it on the way, he was made to
throw the water out and go and bring fresh water;
when two grown-up persons were talking together,
if a child ran between them, he was told that he
had done an uncivil thing. These are only specimens
of their rules for polite behavior. They seem to me
as good as ours.</p>

<p>These Indians were very fond of flowers, of which
the whole country is full. They used to make long
garlands and wreaths, not only to wear on their heads,
but to reach way down to their feet. These they wore
at festivals and celebrations; and sometimes at these
festivals they used to have what they called “song
contests.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the best singers, or poets, would be matched
together to see which could sing the better, or make
the better verses. That seems to me a more interesting
kind of match than the spelling matches we have
in our villages.</p>

<p>But there is nothing of this sort to be seen in San
Gabriel now, or indeed anywhere in California. The
Indians have been driven away by the white people
who wanted their lands; year by year more and more
white people have come, and the Indians have been
robbed of more and more of their lands, and have
died off by hundreds, until there are not many left.</p>

<p>Mr. Connor was much interested in collecting all he
could of the curious stone bowls and pestles they used
to make, and of their baskets and lace work. He
spent much of his time riding about the country; and
whenever he came to an Indian hut he would stop and
ask if they had any stone bowls they would like to sell.</p>

<p>The bowls especially were a great curiosity. Nobody
knew how long ago they had been made. When the
missionaries first came to the country they found the
Indians using them; they had them of all sizes, from
those so large that they are almost more than a man
can lift down to the tiny ones no bigger than a tea-cup.
But big and little, they were all made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
same way out of solid stone, scooped out in the middle,
by rubbing another stone round and round on them.</p>

<p>Even yet people who are searching for such curiosities
sometimes find big grave mounds in which dozens
of them are buried&mdash;buried side by side with the
people who used to eat out of them. There is nothing
left of the people but their skulls and a few bones;
but the bowls will last as long as the world stands.</p>

<h2 id="IMITATION_OF_MARY">IMITATION OF MARY</h2>

<p>Let the life of the Blessed Mary be ever present to
you.…</p>

<p>She was humble of heart, serious in her conversation,
fonder of reading than of speaking.</p>

<p>She placed her confidence rather in the prayer of
the poor than in the uncertain riches of the world.</p>

<p>She was ever intent on her occupations, and accustomed
to make God rather than man the witness of
her thoughts.</p>

<p>She injured no one, wished well to all, reverenced
age, yielded not to envy, avoided all boasting, followed
the dictates of reason, and loved virtue.</p>

<p>In a remote period of American history there lived
in Sleepy Hollow a worthy man whose name was Ichabod
Crane. He sojourned, or, as he expressed it,
“tarried” in that quiet little valley for the purpose of
instructing the children of the vicinity.</p>

<p>He was tall, but very lank, with narrow shoulders,
long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of
his sleeves, and feet that might have served as shovels.
His head was small, with huge ears, large glassy eyes,
and a long snipe nose. To see him striding along the
crest of a hill on a windy day, with his ill-fitting clothes
fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for
some scarecrow escaped from a cornfield.</p>

<p>His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room,
rudely built of logs. It stood in a rather lonely but
pleasant place, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a
brook running close by, and a birch tree growing near
one end of it. From this place of learning the low
murmur of children’s voices, conning over their lessons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
might be heard on a drowsy summer day like the hum
of a beehive. Now and then this was interrupted by
the stern voice of the master, or perhaps by the appalling
sound of a birch twig, as some loiterer was urged
along the flowery path of knowledge.</p>

<p>When school hours were over, the teacher forgot
that he was the master, and was even the companion
and playmate of the older boys; and on holiday afternoons
he liked to go home with some of the smaller ones
who happened to have pretty sisters, or mothers noted
for their skill in cooking.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a wise thing for him to keep on good
terms with his pupils. He earned so little by teaching
school that he could scarcely have had enough to eat
had he not, according to country custom, boarded at
the houses of the children whom he instructed. With
these he lived, by turns, a week at a time, thus going
the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly
goods tied up in a cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>He had many ways of making himself both useful
and agreeable. He helped the farmers in the lighter
labors of their farms, raked the hay at harvest time,
mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove
the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter
fire. He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
petting the children, particularly the youngest; and
he would often sit with a child on one knee and rock
a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.</p>

<p>He was looked upon as a kind of idle, gentlemanlike
personage of finer tastes and better manners than the
rough young men who had been brought up in the
country. He was always welcome at the tea table of
a farmhouse; and his presence was almost sure to bring
out an extra dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or the parade
of a silver teapot. He would walk with the young
ladies in the churchyard between services on Sundays,
gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that
overran the surrounding trees, or sauntering with a
whole bevy of them along the banks of the adjacent
mill pond; while the bashful country youngsters hung
sheepishly back and hated him for his fine manners.</p>

<p>One of his sources of pleasure was to pass long
winter evenings with the Dutch farmers, as they sat
by the fire with a long row of apples roasting and sputtering
along the hearth. He listened to their wondrous
tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and
haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted
houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or
“Galloping Hessian of the Hollow,” as they sometimes
called him. And then he would entertain them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
stories of witchcraft, and would frighten them with
woeful speculations about comets and shooting stars,
and by telling them that the world did really turn
round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>There was pleasure in all this while snugly cuddling
in the chimney corner of a room that was lighted by the
ruddy glow from a crackling wood fire, and where no
ghost dared show its face; but it was a pleasure dearly
bought by the terrors which would beset him during
his walk homeward. How fearful were the shapes
and shadows that fell across his way in the dim and
ghastly glare of a snowy night! How often did he
shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps
on the frosty crust beneath his feet, and dread to look
over his shoulder lest he should behold some uncouth
being tramping close behind him!</p>

<p>On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive
mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he
watched the doings of his little school. In his hand he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
held a ferule, that scepter of despotic power; the birch
of justice reposed on three nails behind the stool, a
constant terror to evil doers; while on the desk were
sundry contraband articles taken from idle urchins,
such as half-eaten apples, popguns, whirligigs, and fly
cages. His scholars were all busily intent upon their
books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye
kept upon the master, and a kind of buzzing stillness
reigned throughout the schoolroom.</p>

<p>This stillness was suddenly interrupted by the appearance
of a negro, in tow-cloth jacket and trousers,
who, mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken
colt, came clattering up to the schoolhouse door.
He brought an invitation to Ichabod to attend a
merrymaking, or “quilting frolic,” to be held that
evening at the house of Herr Van Tassel; and having
delivered his message, he dashed over the brook, and
was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the
importance and hurry of his mission.</p>

<p>All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet
schoolroom. The scholars were hurried through their
lessons. Those who were nimble skipped over half
without being noticed; and those who were slow were
hurried along by a smart application of the rod. Then
books were flung aside without being put away on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shelves; inkstands were overturned, benches thrown
down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour
before the usual time, the children yelping and racketing
about the green, in joy at their early freedom.</p>

<p>The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half
hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing his best and
only suit of rusty black, and arranging his looks by a
bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse.
That he might make his appearance at the
party in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse
from the farmer with whom he was boarding, and,
thus gallantly mounted, rode forth, like a knight-errant
in quest of adventures.</p>

<p>The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow
horse. He was gaunt and shagged, with a slender neck,
and a head like a hammer. His mane and tail were
tangled and knotted with burs. One eye had lost its
pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other still
gleamed with genuine wickedness. He must have had
plenty of fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge
from his name, which was Gunpowder.</p>

<p>Ichabod was a rider suited for such a steed. He
rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees
nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his elbows
stuck out like a grasshopper’s; and as the horse jogged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping
of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top
of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might
be called; and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out
almost to the horse’s tail. Such was the appearance
of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled along the
highway; and it was altogether such an apparition as
is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day. The
sky was clear and serene. The forests had put on their
sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer
kind had been nipped by the frost into brilliant
dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files
of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in
the air. The bark of the squirrel might be heard from
the groves of beech and hickory, and the pensive
whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring
stubble fields.</p>

<p>The small birds fluttered, chirping and frolicking,
from bush to bush, and tree to tree, gay and happy
because of the plenty and variety around them.
There were the twittering blackbirds, flying in sable
clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his
crimson crest and splendid plumage; and the cedar
bird, with its red-tipped wings and yellow-tipped tail;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the blue jay, in his gay, light-blue coat and white
underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and
bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every
songster of the grove.</p>

<p>As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye ranged
with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all
sides he beheld vast store of apples,&mdash;some still hanging
on the trees, some gathered into baskets and barrels
for the market, others heaped up in rich piles for the
cider press. Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian
corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy
coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty
pudding. There, too, were multitudes of yellow pumpkins
turning up their yellow sides to the sun, and giving
ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies.
And anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields,
breathing the odor of the beehive; and as he beheld
them, he dreamed of dainty slapjacks, well buttered,
and garnished with honey.</p>

<p>Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts,
he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which
look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the
mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad
disk down into the west. A few amber clouds floated
in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
horizon was of a fine, golden tint, changing gradually
into a pure apple-green, and from that into the deep
blue of the midheaven. A slanting ray lingered on the
woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts
of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and
purple of their rocky sides.</p>

<p>It was toward evening when Ichabod arrived at the
castle of the Herr Van Tassel. He found it thronged
with the pride and flower of the adjacent country,&mdash;old
farmers, in homespun coats and breeches, blue
stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles;
their brisk little dames, in close-crimped caps and long-waisted
gowns, with scissors and pincushions, and gay
calico pockets hanging on the outside; young girls,
almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where
a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock
showed signs of city innovations; the sons, in short,
square-skirted coats with rows of huge brass buttons,
and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>What a world of charms burst upon the gaze of my
hero as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel’s mansion&mdash;the
ample charms of a Dutch country tea table,
in the sumptuous time of autumn! Such heaped-up
platters of cakes, of various and indescribable kinds,
known only to experienced Dutch housewives!</p>

<p>There were doughnuts and crisp, crumbling crullers;
sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey
cakes, and the whole family of cakes; and then there
were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies;
and slices of ham and smoked beef; and dishes of
preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces;
not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens, together
with bowls of milk and cream; all mingled,
higgledy-piggledy, with the motherly teapot sending
up its clouds of vapor from the midst! I want breath
and time to describe this banquet as I ought, and am
too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod
Crane was not in so great a hurry, but did ample justice
to every dainty.</p>

<p>And now, supper being ended, the sound of music
from the common room summoned to the dance. The
musician was an old, gray-headed negro, who had been
the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more
than half a century. His instrument was as old and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
battered as himself. The greater part of the time he
scraped away on two or three strings, moving his
head with every movement of the bow, and stamping
his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.</p>

<p>Ichabod prided himself on his dancing. Not a
limb, not a fiber about him was idle. How could the
flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and
joyous? When the dance was over, Ichabod joined a
circle of the older folks, who, with Herr Van Tassel,
sat smoking at one end of the piazza, and told stories
of the war and wild and wonderful legends of ghosts
and other supernatural beings.</p>

<p>Some mention was made of a woman in white that
haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often
heard to shriek on wintry nights before a storm. The
chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the
favorite specter of Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman,
who had been heard several times of late patrolling
the country. One man told how he had once met
the horseman and was obliged to get up behind him;
how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and
swamp, until they reached the bridge by the church,
when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton,
threw him into the brook, and sprang away over the
tree tops with a clap of thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>A wild, roistering young man, who was called Brom
Bones, declared that the headless horseman was, after
all, no rider compared with himself. He said that returning
one night from the neighboring village of Sing
Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper;
that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of
punch, and would have won it, too, but just as they
came to the church bridge, the specter bolted and
vanished in a flash of fire.</p>

<p>The party now gradually broke up. The old farmers
gathered together their families in their wagons,
and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow
roads and over the distant hills. Their light-hearted
laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs,
echoed along the silent woodlands, growing fainter and
fainter till they gradually died away, and the late scene
of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted.</p>

<p>It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod
pursued his travel homeward. In the dead hush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
midnight he could hear the barking of a dog on the
opposite shore of the Hudson, but it was so vague and
faint as only to give an idea of the distance between
them. No signs of life occurred near, but now and then
the chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of
a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably
and turning suddenly in his bed.</p>

<p>All the stories that Ichabod had heard about ghosts
and goblins now came crowding into his mind. The
night grew darker and darker. The stars seemed to
sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally
hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely
and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very
place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories
had been laid. In the center of the road stood an
enormous tulip tree, which towered like a giant above
all the other trees of the neighborhood and formed a
kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic,
large as the trunks of ordinary trees, twisting
down almost to the ground, and rising again into the
air.</p>

<p>As Ichabod approached this tree, he began to whistle.
He thought his whistle was answered: it was but a
blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches.
Coming a little nearer, he thought he saw something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
white hanging in the midst of the tree. He paused,
and ceased whistling, but, on looking more narrowly,
perceived that it was a place where the tree had been
struck by lightning, and the white wood laid bare.
Suddenly he heard a groan. His teeth chattered, and
his knees smote against the saddle. It was but the
rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they
were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the
tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards from the tree a small
brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and
thickly wooded glen. A few rough logs laid side by
side served for a bridge over this stream. To pass
this bridge was the severest trial; for it was here that
the unfortunate André had been captured, and under
covert of the thicket of chestnuts and vines by the side
of the road had the sturdy yeomen, who surprised
him, lain concealed. The stream has ever since been
considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings
of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.</p>

<p>As Ichabod approached the stream his heart began
to thump. He gave his horse half a score of kicks in
the ribs, and tried to dash briskly across the bridge;
but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal
made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the fence. Ichabod jerked the rein on the other side,
and kicked lustily with the contrary foot. It was all
in vain. His steed started, it is true, but it was only
to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket
of brambles.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel
upon the ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward,
but came to a stand just by the bridge with a suddenness
that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his
head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the
side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod.
In the dark shadow of the trees he beheld something
huge, black, and towering. It stirred not, but seemed
gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster
ready to spring upon the traveler.</p>

<p>The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his
head with terror. What was to be done? Summoning
up a show of courage, he called out in stammering
accents, “Who are you?” He received no reply.
He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice.
Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgeled the
sides of Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth
into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of
alarm put itself in motion, and, with a scramble and a
bound, stood at once in the middle of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the
form of the unknown might now in some degree be
ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large
dimensions, and mounted on a horse of powerful frame.
He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but
kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on
the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got
over his fright and waywardness.</p>

<p>Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight
companion, and bethought himself of the adventure
of Brom Bones and the headless horseman,
now quickened his steed, in hopes of leaving him behind.
The stranger, however, quickened his horse to
an equal pace. Ichabod drew up, and fell into a walk,
thinking to lag behind; the other did the same. His
heart began to sink within him. There was something
in the moody and dogged silence of his companion that
was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully
accounted for.</p>

<p>On mounting a rising ground, which brought the
figure of his fellow-traveler in relief against the sky,
Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was
headless; but his horror was still more increased on
observing that the head, which should have rested
on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of his saddle. His terror rose to desperation. He
rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder,
hoping, by sudden movement, to give his companion
the slip; but the specter started full jump with him.</p>

<p>Away, then, they dashed, through thick and thin,
stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound.
Ichabod’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air as he
stretched his long, lank body away over his horse’s
head, in the eagerness of his flight.</p>

<p>They had now reached the road which turns off
to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed
with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made
an opposite turn, and plunged headlong down hill to
the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow,
shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it
crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just
beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the
whitewashed church.</p>

<p>Just as he had got halfway through the hollow, the
girths of the saddle gave way, and Ichabod felt it
slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel,
and tried to hold it firm, but in vain. He had just
time to save himself by clasping Gunpowder round
the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he
heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
moment the terror of its owner’s wrath passed across
his mind, for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was
no time for petty fears. He had much ado to keep
his seat, sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on
another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of
his horse’s backbone with a violence that was far from
pleasant.</p>

<p>An opening in the trees now cheered him with the
hope that the church bridge was at hand. “If I can
but reach that bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.”
Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing
close behind him. He even fancied that he felt
his hot breath. Another kick in the ribs, and old
Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered
over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite
side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his
pursuer should vanish in a flash of fire and brimstone.</p>

<p>Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups,
and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod
tried to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It
encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash.
He was tumbled headlong into the dust; and Gunpowder,
the black steed, and the goblin rider passed
by like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The next morning the old horse was found without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly
cropping the grass at his master’s gate. Ichabod
did not make his appearance at breakfast. Dinner
hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at
the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of
the brook; but no schoolmaster.</p>

<p>An inquiry was set on foot, and after much investigation
they came upon his traces. In one part of the
road by the church was found the saddle trampled
in the dirt. The tracks of horses’ hoofs deeply dented
in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced
to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad
part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black,
was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and
close beside it a shattered pumpkin. The brook was
searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not
to be discovered.</p>

<p>As Ichabod was a bachelor, and in nobody’s debt,
nobody troubled his head any more about him. It is
true, an old farmer, who went down to New York on
a visit several years after, brought home the intelligence
that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he
had left the neighborhood, partly through fear of
the goblin and the farmer whose horse he had ridden,
and partly for other reasons; that he had changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his quarters to a distant part of the country, had
kept school and studied law, and finally had been made
a justice of the Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too,
was observed to look very knowing whenever the story
of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty
laugh at the mention of the pumpkin, which led some
to suppose that he knew more about the matter than
he chose to tell.</p>

<p>The Chevalier had found a lad who would be worthy
of his care. To be sure he was but a peasant boy full
of fun and laughter. The Chevalier himself had once
been young and remembered how tempting the sunshine
used to be and the fields and the ripe nuts of
autumn. He had marked with pleasure this handsome
lad, and watched with interest his changing face and
dancing eye as he went on his merry way.</p>

<p>“I shall ask him to my house,” thought the Chevalier,
“and see what he will say to my books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>So Giochino went to the Chevalier’s house and
listened eagerly while the Chevalier told him of the
beautiful verses and stories which many of the books
contained. Now and then the Chevalier would read a
few lines from a poem.</p>

<p>The boy loved poetry. It was sweet in sound and
had a movement like the gliding of boats on still
water. It made him forget everything else,&mdash;even
how he had teased his old music teacher, and that his
mother was sometimes sad.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was a little lonesome, for his mother,
whom he loved dearly, was often far off. She was
working for her boy, saving every cent possible to give
him the musical education for which she had longed.
Here and there throughout Italy she went singing in
one of the traveling opera companies so common in
those days. In her younger years her voice had been
full and strong, but now it was failing and she wondered
what would happen to Giochino.</p>

<p>But the boy’s heart was too joyous to be cast down by
poverty or trouble. The days were bright and sunny,
why should he not be gay? His voice was clear, true,
pure in tone, and almost of its own accord broke into
song. Occasionally he, too, would earn a little money
by singing at the theater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time he was able to study music with a master
and finally entered the conservatory at Bologna. Here
he was taught some of the more difficult things about
music.</p>

<p>It was not long before he discovered that he already
knew enough to write operas. He was delighted. He
would go to seek his fortune.</p>

<p>His teacher, realizing that he had extraordinary
talent, wished him to continue his study further and
even offered to instruct him in the stately music of the
Church, if he would remain. But the youth did not
heed his offer and started forth.</p>

<p>In his happy, aimless way he went from place to
place. He sang, he accompanied, he directed and
composed. He was always good-natured, always generous,
and never without friends.</p>

<p>It was evening in Venice. The opera was just over.
People were thronging from the door of the opera house.
They were talking excitedly. Evidently they were
much pleased. Giochino Rossini’s opera, “Tancred,”
had been presented for the first time. It had been
received with wild applause.</p>

<p>Rossini was surprised at this. “I fancied,” he said,
“that, after hearing my opera, they would put me into
the madhouse. But they are madder than I.”</p>

<p>When he was but twenty-four Rossini produced
what has been, perhaps, the most popular of his operas,
“The Barber of Seville.” But fame alone could not
make him content. Beyond Italy the world was wide.
The spirit of the man was as restless as that of the boy.
He went to Vienna, and finally to Paris.</p>

<p>In Paris he felt he could work at his best. Here he
composed his great masterpiece in opera, “William
Tell.” It was the story in music and song of the great
Swiss hero, of whom you have doubtless heard many
tales. For years the hero had seen his country bound
under the hand of a tyrant. His soul was on fire with
indignation. His country must be freed. He would
make it free.</p>

<p>Nothing but grand and noble music could tell such a
story. Yet Rossini has told it wonderfully. The opera
was brought out in Paris and has been played many
times since.</p>

<p>Although as yet you may not have listened to any
of the music which has been mentioned thus far, the
most of you have probably heard many times Rossini’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
finest composition. When he wrote it, he was forty-five;
and when it was done, he wrote no longer. This
was his last message to the world. This was the
“Stabat Mater,” sung for the first time on Good
Friday.</p>

<p>In his house in Paris Rossini gathered about him
many friends, among them young men who desired
to become musicians, poets, or writers. His generous
heart was full to the last of merriment and song, though
as a composer he was silent. He was born at Pesaro,
Italy, February 29, 1792, and died in Paris, November
13, 1868.</p>

<p>Pilar was a young peasant woman. I do not know
from what village she came, somewhere in the neighborhood
of Malaga. She was paid three dollars a
month, and she “found” herself. A man cook in that
happy land gets five dollars a month, but times were
bad, and my friends had for three years to content
themselves with a woman cook. She cooked well,
though, and cheerfully, and she prepared more meals
in the twenty-four hours than any other cook I ever
heard of.</p>

<p>She seemed to have identified herself thoroughly
with the family, and to work with a zealous love for
them all. There was, however, one of the many
children for whom she had a special affection, a very
delicate little maiden of two and a half. During the
autumn this child had been desperately ill. The
doctors gave no hope. Pilar in anguish prayed for
her recovery, and promised the Bestower of life that
if He would spare little Anita, she would, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
end of Holy Week, carry to the shrine on the top of
the “Calvary” outside the town, one pound of olive
oil to be burned in His honor. She promised a great
many prayers besides, which she managed to get said,
in the intervals of her frying and stewing and boiling.</p>

<p>Well, the little girl, contrary to the doctors, began
to mend, and finally was entirely restored to health.
Pilar was most grateful, and said many <i>Aves</i> in thanksgiving.
The winter was a busy one, and then Lent
came and seemed not less busy in that big household.
Pilar did not forget the pound of oil, but there never
seemed a moment when she could ask a half day to go
and carry it to the shrine. Holy Week came, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,&mdash;what should she
do! She could scarcely get away from her work even
to go out to her parish church on Holy Thursday to
say a little prayer before the Repository, where, throned
in flowers and lighted with myriad candles, the Blessed
Sacrament is kept till the morning of Good Friday.</p>

<p>As to going to seven churches and saying her prayers
before each Repository as other people did, that, alas!
was not “for the likes of her.” She had a dumb,
deep-down feeling, however, that the good God knew,
and that it would be all right. On her way back
from her hurried prayer at the church, a procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
passed which she watched for a moment. But this
only proved painful, for it had begun to rain, and her
pious Southern soul was aflame with wrath that the
image of the Blessed Redeemer should be exposed to
the storm.</p>

<p>“They don’t care about wetting his dear curls,”
she cried, “as long as they can have a good procession.”</p>

<p>She shook her fist at the crowd, and came away in
tears. Her mistress, a devout Catholic, tried to console
her by reminding her that, after all, it was only
an image and not the dear Lord she loved. Oh, she
knew <i>that</i>; but “it was cruel, but it was shameful!”</p>

<p>She felt as a mother would feel if the dress of her
dead baby, or its little half-worn shoe, were spoiled
by the caprice or cold-heartedness of some one who
had no feeling for it. All together Holy Thursday
was not very consoling to Pilar, and the pound of oil
grew heavier every hour.</p>

<p>The next day, Good Friday, she had only time to
go to church through the silent streets, where no wheels
were heard, and say her prayers and look at the black,
black altars and the veiled statues. That night, after
her work was done, and the last baby had been served
with its last porridge, she put her kitchen in hurried
order, and stole out silently. She had bought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
pound of oil at a little shop in the next street and,
hiding it under her shawl, turned her steps towards
Barcenillas.</p>

<p>The night was black and tempestuous. A hot, dry
wind blew; occasionally a gust brought a few drops
of rain, but more often it was a gale which made the
street lamps blink, and whirled the dust around her.
It was a long way to the suburb; it was late; there
were few abroad, but no matter, the good Lord knew
why she was out, and He would take care of her.</p>

<p>There are no street cars running in the days of Holy
Week. From Holy Thursday till after the cathedral
bells ring for first vespers on Holy Saturday, no wheels
move in the streets of Malaga.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when she got to Barcenillas.
She crossed the silent plaza, passed through the gate,
and began the ascent of the steep hill. There is a
great broad road that winds up it, and at every “station”
there is a lamp burning. She knelt at each as
she reached it. But the place was very lonely; the eucalyptus
trees shook and whispered to each other, and
the lamps were dim and flickered in the rough wind.</p>

<p>The night before there had been processions all
through the night, crowds upon crowds going up the
hill; she would not have been lonely then. But she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
could not get away, because of little Josef’s being ill
and needing the water heated for his bath every hour.
Yes, it would have been nicer last night, with all the
priests, and all the chanting, and all the flaming torches.
But the good God knew all about it,&mdash;why she did
not come then, when she wanted to. She would not
worry, but she said her prayers with chattering teeth,
and many furtive looks behind her.</p>

<p>At last she reached the summit, where in a little
chapel burned the light that could be seen for miles
around Malaga. There a solitary brother knelt, saying
his beads, and keeping watch. She said her last
prayers at the altar, and left the votive oil with the
friar, who commended her piety and was very kind.
As she came out, the clouds broke and the Paschal moon
shone through them, and the broad road led down with
smooth ease towards the sleeping, silent city. Her
steps made just as lonely echoes on the stones of the
deserted streets, but she felt herself favored of heaven,
as no doubt she was, and all her fears were gone.</p>

<p>It was after three o’clock when she let herself in at
the kitchen door; and it was several weeks before her
mistress learned, by accident, of the dolorous little
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>St. Wulfram and his monks had much work for a
time. The Frisians came in crowds for Christian instructions
and baptism. It was a great and hard task
to teach human beings in the lowest stage of development.
Moreover, the teachings of the missionaries
were opposed in all things to the traditional customs
of the people. Many wrongs, such as slavery, for
instance, could not be set aside at once. Moreover,
if the people were to be made peaceful and weaned
from their wildness, they had to be taught other
ways of support than plundering and hunting.</p>

<p>So the Benedictines taught the converts not only
Christian doctrine, but how to plow and to plant.
They built dunes to hold out the devastating sea, and
sent to their abbey home for seeds and implements.
In a few years the face of Frisia was greatly changed.</p>

<p>Ratbodo had given Wulfram land and a dwelling
near his own residence. In this way he could best
keep track of everything that happened at the mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The king himself remained obdurate in his paganism.
Once he said, tauntingly, to the entreating Wulfram,
that if the Christian God would work a miracle for
him especially, he would be converted. Wulfram reminded
him of the miracles he had seen and had not
been converted. Then Ratbodo said that if the
table in front of him were changed into gold, he would
yield; but Wulfram, in righteous indignation, told
him how childish was such a request.</p>

<p>All the while the chieftains were urging the king to
send away the bishop. But he laughed at them, saying
that what Wulfram had built up he himself would
destroy in ten days when the time came, just as had
been done in the case of many others. Even the king’s
little son, Clodio, was baptized and died a Christian,
but the king only smiled. His day was coming, he held.</p>

<p>Then Wulfram went back to Fontinella to get
more monks, laborers, and lay brothers for his work
in Frisia. The converted Frisians were beginning
to realize the blessings of regular and well-ordered
work. There were more and more laborers and fewer
sea robbers and warriors. Nevertheless, the great
mass of the Frisian people remained obstinate, following
the example of the king and the great chiefs.</p>

<p>Among the gods whose wrath the Frisians most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
feared was the god of the sea. The lowness of the
land made frequent inundations inevitable. Besides,
Frisians, when not robbing, were fishing, or living
on the water in some way. Thus they were always
anxious to pacify the mighty god of the floods.</p>

<p>On this day, too, a great multitude, together with
the king and the chieftains, were gathered at the sea-coast,
waiting to soothe the water deity by human
sacrifice. The lot had fallen on two little boys this
time, the only children of a widow. At the time of
low tide the little ones were laid on a projecting point
of land, so that the rising waters would cover them.
Their feet were tied so cunningly that the childish
hands could not undo the knots. Thus they sat on
the beach, waiting the waters that were to be their
death.</p>

<p>Several hundred feet back, the crowds were gathered
to watch the unhappy spectacle. In the foreground
sat a young woman, the mother of the children, weeping
and moaning in her grief, without, however, waking
the faintest sympathy in the hearts of the by-standers.</p>

<p>The waters were even then advancing on the point
of land, and a strong wind was driving up the flood
in great waves. The little ones began to scream in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
terror as the spray struck them, and the mother sprang
to her feet. If she had not been held fast, she would
have flung herself into the water with her children.
Gradually the land disappeared; nothing was left
but the raised point to which the children clung. One
could see how the older boy was trying to hold up his
little brother.</p>

<p>“King!” said a voice, ringing with a holy anger,
“why this abomination before the eyes of almighty
God?”</p>

<p>Ratbodo started and the chieftains stared in silent
astonishment.</p>

<p>“We are offering sacrifice to the god of the waters,”
said the king, after a moment. “Go take the victims
away from him if you can; they may be your slaves
and the slaves of your God for the rest of time,” he
added with a sneer.</p>

<p>“So be it,” answered Wulfram. Turning, he made
the sign of the cross over the rising tide and walked
out as if on solid land. The Christians present in the
crowd cried aloud for joy, but the pagans stood in
wonder bordering on fear. The king himself was
most moved by the miraculous sight. His eyes were
fixed, his face pale as death. He was convinced that
in the saint walking thus unharmed over the waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he saw an unmistakable manifestation of the power of
the Christian God.</p>

<p>“That is even more than a golden table,” he whispered
tremblingly.</p>

<p>Wulfram lifted the children out of the water and
carried them to the land. At once the Frisians
crowded about him, asking to be made Christians.
Ratbodo himself said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is but right that a man should keep his word.
I said to you years ago that if your God would make
a golden table before my eyes, I would become a
Christian. But He did more. He made a solid floor
of the moving sea. Come to me every day and instruct
me.”</p>

<p>In 1672, letters from Quebec informed Marquette
that the government had taken up the project of exploring
the Mississippi, and that he was the missionary
selected to accompany the expedition. His heart
exulted at the prospect. The hope of a glorious martyrdom
while opening the way to future heralds of the
Cross buoyed him up, though in his humility he never
spoke of martyrdom. To him it was but a death, “to
cease to offend God.”</p>

<p>The winter was spent by the two explorers in studying
all that had yet been learned of the great river, in
gathering around them every Indian wanderer, and
amid the tawny group drawing their first rude map of
the Mississippi, and the water courses that led to it.
And on this first map, traced doubtless kneeling on the
ground, they set down the name of each tribe they
were to pass, each important point to be met. The
undertaking was dangerous, but it was not to be rash:
all was the result of calm, cool investigation. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
spring they embarked at Mackinaw in two frail bark
canoes; each with his paddle in hand, and full of hope,
they soon plied them merrily over the crystal waters
of the lake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus181.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">They happily glided into the great river.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>All was new to Marquette. He had now attained the
limit of former discoveries, the new world was before
them; they looked back a last adieu to the waters,
which, great as the distance was, connected them with
Quebec and their countrymen; they knelt on the shore
to offer, by a new devotion, their lives, their honor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and their undertaking to their beloved mother the
Virgin Mary Immaculate; then, launching on the
broad Wisconsin, they sailed slowly down its current,
amid its vine-clad isles and its countless sand bars.</p>

<p>No sound broke the stillness, no human form appeared,
and at last, after sailing seven days, on the
17th of June they happily glided into the great river.
Joy that could find no utterance in words filled the
grateful heart of Marquette. The broad river of the
Conception, as he named it, now lay before them,
stretching away hundreds of miles to an unknown sea.</p>

<p>“The Mississippi River,” he writes, “has its source
in several lakes in the country of the nations at the
north; it is narrow at the mouth of the Wisconsin;
its current, which runs south, is slow and gentle. On
the right is a considerable chain of very high mountains,
and on the left fine lands; it is in many places studded
with islands. On sounding we found ten fathoms
of water. Its breadth varies greatly; sometimes it
is three quarters of a league broad, and then narrows
in to less than two hundred yards. We followed its
course quietly, as it bears south and southeast to the
forty-second degree.</p>

<p>“Then we perceive that the whole face of the country
changes. Scarcely a forest or mountain is now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sight. The islands increase in beauty and are covered
with finer trees; we see nothing but deer and elk, wild
geese and swans unable to fly, as they are here moulting.
From time to time we encounter monstrous fish,
one of which struck our canoe with such violence that
I took it for a large tree that would knock our frail
craft to pieces. Another time we perceived on the
water a bearded monster with a tiger’s head, a pointed
muzzle like a wild cat; ears erect, a gray head but a
jet-black neck. It was the only one we beheld.</p>

<p>“When we cast our nets we took sturgeon, and a
very strange fish resembling a trout, but with larger
mouth and smaller eyes and snout. From the last
projects a large bone, three fingers wide, and a cubit
long; the end is round and as wide as a hand. When
the fish leaps out of water, the weight of this bone
often throws it back.</p>

<p>“Having descended the river to 41° 2´, still keeping
the same direction, we found that turkeys took the
place of other wild birds, and wild cattle replaced
other animals. We call them wild cattle, because they
resemble our domestic ones. They are not longer,
but almost as bulky again, and more corpulent. Our
man killed one, and the three of us could move it
only with great difficulty. The head is very large, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
forehead flat and a half yard broad between the horns,
which resemble exactly those of our oxen, but are
black and longer. A large crop hangs down from the
neck, and there is a high hump on the back. The
whole head, neck, and part of the shoulders are covered
with a great mane like a horse’s; it is a foot long
and gives them a hideous appearance, and as it falls
over the eyes prevents their seeing straight ahead.</p>

<p>“The rest of the body is covered with a coarse curly
hair like the wool of our sheep, but much stronger and
thicker. This is shed every summer, and then the
skin is as soft as velvet. At this time the Indians
employ the skins to make beautiful robes, which they
paint with various colors. The flesh and fat are
excellent, and furnish the best dish at banquets. They
are very fierce, and not a year passes without their
killing some Indian. When attacked, they take a
man with their horns, if they can, lift him up, and
then dash him on the ground, and trample him to
death.</p>

<p>“When you fire at them from a distance with gun
or bow, you must throw yourself on the ground as
soon as you fire, and hide in the grass, for if they perceive
the person who fired, they rush on him and
attack him. As their feet are large and rather short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
they do not generally move fast, unless they are
provoked. They are scattered over the prairies like
herds of cattle. I have seen four hundred of them in
a band.”</p>

<p>At last, on the 25th of June, they descried footprints
on the shore. They now took heart again,
and Joliet and the missionary, leaving their five men
in the canoes, followed a little beaten path to discover
who the tribe might be. They traveled on in silence
almost to the cabin doors, when they halted, and with
a loud halloo proclaimed their coming. Three villages
lay before them; the first, roused by the cry, poured
forth its motley group, which halted at the sight of the
newcomers and the well-known dress of the missionary.</p>

<p>“They deputed four old men to come and speak
with us,” says Marquette. “Two carried tobacco
pipes richly adorned and trimmed with feathers of
many kinds. They walked slowly, lifting their pipes
toward the sun, as if offering them to him to
smoke, but yet without uttering a single word. They
were a long time coming the short distance between
us and the village. Having at last reached us, they
stopped to examine us carefully.</p>

<p>“On seeing these ceremonies which are used only
with friends, I took courage, more especially as I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
they wore European goods, which made me judge them
to be allies of the French. I therefore spoke to them
first, and asked them who they were. They answered:
‘We are Illinois,’ and in token of peace they offered us
their pipes to smoke. They then invited us to their
village, where the whole tribe impatiently awaited us.</p>

<p>“At the door of the cabin in which we were to be
received was an old man awaiting us in a very remarkable
attitude. It is their usual ceremony in
receiving strangers. This man stood perfectly naked,
with his hands stretched out and raised toward the
sun, as if he wished to screen himself from its rays,
which nevertheless passed through his fingers to his
face. When we came near him, he addressed this
compliment to us: ‘How beautiful is the sun, O Frenchman,
when thou comest to visit us! All our town
awaits thee, and thou shalt enter all our cabins in
peace,’ He then took us into his, where there was a
crowd of people, who devoured us with their eyes, but
maintained the deepest silence. We heard, however,
these words occasionally addressed to us: ‘Well done,
brothers, to visit us!’”</p>

<p>Then the great peace calumet was brought and
solemnly smoked, and the two Frenchmen were conducted
to the village of the great sachem. Here, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
they were received with pomp, and the calumet was
again smoked. Marquette explained the object of
their voyage to visit the nations living on the great
river, and announce to them the word of God their
Creator. They told the Illinois that they were sent
by the great chief of the French, and asked information
as to the nations between them and the sea.</p>

<p>The sachem presented them an Indian slave, saying:
“I thank thee, Blackgown, and thee, Frenchman, for
taking so much pains to come and visit us; never has
the earth been so beautiful, nor the sun so bright as
to-day; never has our river been so calm, nor so free
from rocks, which your canoes have removed as they
passed; never has our tobacco had so fine a flavor,
nor our corn appeared so beautiful as we behold it
to-day. Here is my son, whom I give thee, that thou
mayst know my heart. I pray thee to take pity on
me and all my nation. Thou knowest the Great Spirit
who has made us all; thou speakest to Him and hearest
His word. Ask Him to give me life and health, and
come and dwell with us that we may know Him.”</p>

<p>They feasted the two Frenchmen, and gave them a
calumet of peace as a safeguard against hostile tribes,
but tried to persuade them to go no farther.</p>

<p>One day a vast multitude follows our Blessed Lord
up a mountain side. They come trooping after Him,
men, women, and children; their homes, their business,
all the cares of this life, by common consent left behind.
Now He has stopped and turned round, facing
them. He waits long and patiently as they come toiling
up, guiding them with His hand to go here and
there where they may hear Him best.</p>

<p>It is His first great Sermon that He is going to
preach, this Sermon on the Mount, and it is not only
for the numbers beyond all reckoning gathered together
here, but for all that shall come into this world
and have to be taught what they must do to save their
souls. Therefore He would speak so solemnly and from
such a lofty place. He sits down, and the Twelve come
and stand around Him, or sit on the ground at His feet.
The people press round as close as they can, and when
all are seated and quiet He begins to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>What will the text of this great Preacher be?
What is the thought uppermost in His mind and
heart? This&mdash;to teach us what we must do to be
happy. He knows that we are made for happiness,
and that we long to be happy. But He knows, too,
that very many try to find happiness in things that
will not satisfy them, in the riches, pleasures, and
honors of this world which can never content our
hearts. And so He tells us in the beginning of His
Sermon on the Mount who are really blessed or
happy.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the
land.</p>

<p>“Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>“Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice,
for they shall have their fill.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see
God.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
the children of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice’
sake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p>Blessed the sufferers for whom Heaven is waiting!
this is the text of the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p><i>The poor in spirit</i> are those who, having little of the
good things of this life, are content with what God has
given them, and do not envy those who are better off.
Those, too, who having a sufficiency or an abundance
of the pleasant things of this world, do not let their
hearts get too fond of them, are ready to give them
up if God should take them away, and are generous
in sharing them with those in need. To poor, such as
these, our Lord promises all the riches of Heaven by
and by.</p>

<p><i>The meek</i> are those who have gained a mastery over
anger and revengeful thoughts. They possess as conquerors
three lands&mdash;the land of their own soul, which
they control as lords and masters, the Land of Heaven,
where nothing will trouble them any more, and, strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to say, that very land in which they seemed to be overcome.
For in the little difficulties and differences of
daily life, it is those that yield who are really victors.
How many conquests has meekness made!</p>

<p><i>The mourners</i> are those who all their lives long have
a quiet, loving sorrow for their sins&mdash;not as though
they were unforgiven, but just because they are forgiven,
because they have offended Him who forgives so readily
and so often. Those, too, are blessed mourners who
remember when sorrow comes that He who loves them
only permits it for their good, and that in a very little
while He will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and
they shall be comforted, “nor mourning, nor crying,
nor sorrow shall be any more.”</p>

<p><i>Who hunger and thirst after justice.</i> The soul, like
the body, has its hunger and thirst. Our Lord says
those are blessed who take care to feed it with those
things which keep it alive in the grace of God, with
prayer, and instruction, and the Sacraments. Blessed
are those who hunger after this spiritual food, who are
always trying to get more and more of God’s grace,
who go hungry to prayer, hungry to Confession and
Communion. Almighty God says, “Open thy mouth
and I will fill it.” And our Blessed Lady sings in her
canticle, “He hath fed the hungry with good things.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
It was because all the saints hungered like this that so
much was given them.</p>

<p><i>The merciful.</i> There is nothing our Lord tells us
so often and so plainly as this&mdash;that to obtain mercy
from God we must ourselves be merciful. If we wish
Him to judge us kindly and to forgive our many faults,
we must be forgiving and kind. “Be merciful,” He
says, “as your Heavenly Father is merciful.” He tells
us that at the Last Day He will say “Come” to those
who have been merciful to others for His sake, and
“Depart from Me” to those who have been unmerciful
to the poor and needy, and therefore to Him. For
what we do to His least brethren He counts as done
to Himself. If, then, we want to hear His sweet
invitation on that dreadful Day, we know how to secure
it&mdash;“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy.”</p>

<p><i>The clean of heart.</i> The reward and the joy of the
next life is to see God. There are many joys in Heaven&mdash;freedom
from pain and care, the delights of the glorified
body, the society of the Angels and Saints, reunion
with those we loved on earth. But all these are as
nothing compared with the Vision of God. It is this
that makes Heaven what it is. Without this all the
rest would not satisfy us. But to see the All Holy God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
we must be holy. In Heaven all are clothed with white
robes, and the nearer the approach to the Great White
Throne, the more dazzlingly white is the raiment. We
must be getting ready to join that spotless throng.
How? By taking as much pains to keep our soul free
from stain as we do to prevent soiling our dress when
we go along a miry road; by shunning with care all
mortal sin and deliberate venial sin; by being careful
in our examination of conscience, and often cleansing
our soul in the Sacrament of Penance, and by frequent
acts of contrition. If we do this we shall be among the
clean of heart, and one day we shall see God.</p>

<p><i>The peacemakers.</i> “Some there are who are neither
at peace with themselves nor suffer others to be at peace.
And some there are who keep themselves in peace and
study to restore peace to others.” Gladness goes with
these peacemakers; they turn aside little words and
jokes that would give pain, and come among us like our
Blessed Lord, whose favorite word of greeting was,
“Peace be to you.” They are so like their Father
who is in Heaven that they deserve to be called in a
special way His children.</p>

<p><i>The persecuted.</i> If our Lord had not told us these
are blessed, should we ever have guessed it? To be
persecuted seems such a terrible thing, and so indeed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is unless we can bring ourselves to think more of Him
for whose sake we suffer than of the suffering itself.
Perhaps we may have known the quiet happiness of
being by the side of one we loved who was in pain. The
thought that our presence and our sympathy soothed
that dear one was greater joy than any pleasure to be
found elsewhere. Something like this is the gladness
those have even now who for our Lord’s sake are hated
and persecuted. They know that if they are like Him
in His suffering they will be like Him one day in His
glory. Are they not blessed then?</p>

<p>And now let us stop awhile to look at our dear Master
and His hearers. The Twelve are listening with
reverent and fixed attention, their eyes riveted on His
blessed face. The people gaze at Him in amazement
and delight. They have been taught to hate their
enemies, to seek revenge, to think that poverty and
suffering are the signs of God’s anger, that an abundance
of corn and wine and cattle are the rewards for
which a good man must hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Their beatitudes would have been, “Blessed are
the rich and the successful, those that laugh and are
held in honor by men.” How unlike these to the
blessed ones of Jesus of Nazareth! His way to happiness
was a hard way, but they knew as they looked up
into His face that it was the right way. And they felt
that He could not only teach but help them. Had
they known the story of His life as we do they would
have seen that He had first practised all He taught.
He was so poor that He had not where to lay His head.
He was meek and humble of heart, the Man of sorrows,
the great Peacemaker.</p>

<p>After the Sermon our Lord comes down from the
Mount, conversing familiarly with His disciples, His
simple congregation flocking after Him, trying to get
near Him, all so refreshed by His company and His
words. Hear them talking of Him among themselves,
saying, “We never heard the like.”</p>

<p>Oh, if we had seen our Blessed Lord as these happy
people saw Him, if we had followed Him about with the
crowd, had sat at His feet as He taught, and watched
Him as He laid His hands on the eyes of the blind and
the sores of the poor lepers&mdash;how we should have loved
Him!</p>

<p>About four hundred years ago there came to Spain
an Italian sailor who believed that the earth is round.
Such a belief may not seem at all strange to us, but to
the people of that time it appeared to be very foolish
and unreasonable. Almost everybody laughed at the
Italian, and called him a silly fellow.</p>

<p>“Have you eyes?” they asked. “If so, you need
only to open them and look about you to see that the
earth is as flat as the top of a table.”</p>

<p>“You may think it is flat,” he answered, “and indeed
it does appear to be so. But I know it is round; and
if I had only a good ship or two, and some trusty sailors,
I would prove it to you. I would sail westward
across the great ocean, and in the end would reach the
Indies and China, which must be on the other side of
the great round world.”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of such nonsense!” cried his learned
critics. “Everybody knows that China and the Indies
are in the far East, and that they can be reached only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
a dangerous voyage through the Mediterranean Sea,
and long journeys with camels across the great desert.
Yet, here is Mr. Crack-brain, an Italian sailor, who says
he can go to the East by sailing west. One might as
well try to reach the moon by going down into a deep
well.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand me,” answered the man
whom they had called Mr. Crack-brain. “Here is an
apple. Let us suppose that it is the earth. I stick a
pin on this side, and call it Spain. On the other side I
stick another pin, and call it the Indies. Now suppose
a fly lights upon the apple at the point which I have
called Spain. By turning to the right, or eastward, he
can travel round to the Indies with but little trouble;
or by turning to the left, or westward, he can reach the
same place with just as much ease, and in really a
shorter time. Do you see?”</p>

<p>“Do we see?” said his hearers. “Most certainly
we see the apple, and we can imagine that we see the
fly. It is very hard, however, to imagine that the earth
is an apple, or anything like it. For, suppose that it
were so: what would become of all the water in the
seas and the great ocean? Why, it would run off at
the blossom end of the apple, which you call the South
Pole; and all the rocks and trees and men would follow
it. Or, suppose that men could stick to the lower part
of the earth as the fly does to the lower part of the apple&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
very silly it would be to think of them walking
about with their heads hanging down!”</p>

<p>“And suppose,” said one of the doubters, who
thought himself very wise,&mdash;“suppose that the earth
is round, and suppose that the water should not spill
off, and suppose you should sail to the other side, as
you want to do, how are you to get back? Did anybody
ever hear of a ship sailing uphill?”</p>

<p>And so, with sneering remarks, the wise men dismissed
the whole subject. They said it was not worth
while for them to spend their time in talking about
such things. But the man whom they had called Mr.
Crack-brain would not give up his theory. He was
not the first man to believe that the earth is round&mdash;this
he knew; but he hoped to be the first to prove
it by sailing westward, and thus finally reaching the
Indies, and the rich countries of the far East. And yet
he had no ship, he was very poor, and the few friends
whom he had were not able to give him any help.</p>

<p>“My only hope,” he said, “is to persuade the king
and queen to furnish me with a ship.”</p>

<p>But how should an unknown Italian sailor make himself
heard by the king and queen of the most powerful
country in Europe?</p>

<p>The great men at the king’s court ridiculed him.
“You had better buy a fisherman’s boat,” they said,
“and try to make an honest living with your nets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Men of your kind have no business with kings. As to
your crazy theory about the shape of the earth, only
think of it! How dare you, the son of an Italian wool-comber,
imagine that you know more about it than the
wisest men in the world?”</p>

<p>But he did not despair. For years he followed the
king’s court from place to place. Most people looked
upon him as a kind of harmless lunatic who had gotten
a single idea in his head and was unable to think of anything
else. But there were a few good and wise men
who listened to his theories, and after studying them
carefully began to believe that there was some truth in
them.</p>

<p>One of these men was Father Perez, the prior of the
convent of La Rabida, and, to please this good prior,
the queen at last sent for the sailor and asked him to
tell her all about his strange theories and his plans for
sailing west and reaching the East.</p>

<p>“You say that, if you had the vessels and the men,
you would sail westward and discover new lands on
the farther side of the great ocean,” said the queen.
“What reasons have you for supposing that there are
any such lands?”</p>

<p>“My first reason is that, since the earth is round like
a ball, the countries of China and the Indies must lie
in a westward direction and can, sooner or later, be
reached by sailing across the sea,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“You, yourself, have heard the story of St. Brandon,
the Scottish priest, who, eight hundred years ago, was
driven by a storm far across the ocean, and how at last
he landed upon a strange and unknown shore. I doubt
not but that this country was one of the outlying
islands of the Indies, or perhaps the eastern shore of
China.</p>

<p>“Not very long ago, Martin Vincent, a sea captain
of Lisbon, ventured to go a distance of four hundred
miles from land. There he picked up a piece of wood,
with strange marks and carvings upon it, which had
been drifted from the west by strong winds. Other
seafaring men have found, far out in the ocean, reeds
and light wood, such as travelers say are found in some
parts of the Indies, but nowhere in Europe. And if
any one should want more proofs than these, it would
not be hard to find them. There is a story among the
people of the far north which relates that, about five
hundred years ago, some bold sea rovers from Iceland
discovered a wild, wooded country many days’ sail to
the westward. Indeed, it is said that these men tried
to form a settlement there, and that they sent more
than one shipload of grapes and timber back to Iceland.
Now, it is very plain to me that this country of Vinland,
as they called it, was no other than a part of the
northern coast of China or Japan.”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the queen cared whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the earth was round or flat; nor is it likely that her
mind was ever troubled with questions of that kind.
But she thought that if this man’s theories were true,
and there were lands rich in gold and spices on the other
side of the ocean, it would be a fine thing for the queen
and king of Spain to possess them. The Italian sailor
had studied his subject well, and he certainly knew
what he was talking about. He had told his story so
well that the queen was almost ready to believe that he
was right. But she was very busy just then, in a war
with the Moors, and she had little time to think about
anything else. If the Italian would wait till everything
else could be settled, she would see whether a ship or two
might not be fitted out for his use.</p>

<p>For seven years this man with a new idea kept on
trying to find some one who was able and willing to
help him carry out the plans which he had so much at
heart. At last, broken in health and almost penniless,
he gave up hope, and was about to leave Spain forever.
It was then that one of his friends, Luis St. Angel,
pleaded his case before the queen.</p>

<p>“It will cost but little to fit out two or three ships
for him. If the undertaking should prove to be a failure
you would not lose much. But if it should succeed,
only think what vast riches and how great honor will
be won for Spain!”</p>

<p>“I will take the risk!” cried the queen, at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“If the money cannot be had otherwise, I will sell my
jewels to get it. Find him, and bring him before me;
and let us lose no more time about this business.”</p>

<p>St. Angel hastened to obey.</p>

<p>“Do you know whether Christopher Columbus has
passed out through this gate to-day?” he asked of the
soldier who was standing guard at one of the gates of
the old city of Granada.</p>

<p>“Christopher Columbus? Who is he?” asked the
soldier.</p>

<p>“He is a gray-bearded man, rather tall, with a stoop
in his shoulders. When last seen he was riding on a
small, brown mule, and coming this way.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Do you mean the fellow who has been trying
to make people believe that the earth is round?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the man.”</p>

<p>“He passed through here not half an hour ago. His
mule is a very slow traveler, and if you follow, you can
easily overtake him before he has gone far.”</p>

<p>St. Angel gave the rein to his swift horse, and galloped
onward in pursuit of Columbus. It was not long until
the slow-paced mule, with its sad rider, was seen plodding
along the dusty highway. The man was too busy
with his own thoughts to heed the sound of the ringing
hoofs behind him.</p>

<p>“Christopher Columbus!” cried his friend, “turn
about, and come back with me. I have good news for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you. Queen Isabella bids me say that she will help
you, and that you shall have the ships and the men for
which you ask. And she hopes that you may find a
new way to the East, and perhaps discover unknown
lands on the farther side of the great ocean. Turn
about, and come back with me!”</p>

<p>One morning in August, 1492, there was a great stir
in the little seaport town of Palos in Spain. At break
of day the streets were full of people. Long before
sunrise the shore was lined with anxious men, women,
and children. All were talking about the same thing;
some were weeping; some appeared to be angry; some
were in despair.</p>

<p>“Only think of it,” said one. “Think of sailing into
seas where the water is always boiling hot.”</p>

<p>“And if you escape being scalded,” said another,
“then there are those terrible sea beasts that are large
enough to swallow ships and sailors at a mouthful.”</p>

<p>“It is all on account of that Italian sailor who says
that the world is round,” said a third. “He has persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
several persons, who ought to know better, that
he can reach the East by sailing west.”</p>

<p>Moored near the shore were three small ships. They
were but little larger than fishing boats; and in these
frail vessels Columbus was going to venture into the
vast unknown sea, in search of strange lands and of a
new and better way to distant India.</p>

<p>Two of the ships, the “Niña” and the “Pinta,”
had no decks and were covered only at the ends where
the sailors slept. The third, called the “Santa Maria,”
was larger and had a deck, and from its masthead
floated the flag of Columbus. It was toward these
three ships that the eyes of the people on shore were
directed; it was about these ships and the men on
board of them that all were talking.</p>

<p>On the deck of the largest ship stood Columbus, and
by his side was good Father Perez, praying that the
voyagers might be blessed with fair winds and a smooth
sea, and that the brave captain might be successful in
his quest. Then the last good-bys were spoken, the
moorings were cast loose, the sails were spread; and, a
little before sunrise, the vessels glided slowly out of
the harbor and into the vast western ocean. The
people stood on the shore and watched, while the sails
grew smaller and smaller and at last were lost to
sight below the line of sea and sky.</p>

<p>“Alas! We shall never see them again,” said some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
returning to their homes. But others remained all
day by the shore talking about the strange idea that
there were unknown lands in the distant West.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles southwest of Palos there is a group
of islands called the Canary Islands. These were well
known to the people of that time, and belonged to
Spain. But sailors seldom ventured beyond them, and
no one knew of any land farther to the west. It was
to these islands that Columbus first directed his course.
In six days the three little vessels reached the Canary
Islands. The sailing had been very slow. The rudder
of one of the ships had not been well made and had soon
been broken. And so, now, much time was wasted
while having a new rudder made and put in place.</p>

<p>It was not until the 6th of September that Columbus
again set sail, pushing westward into unknown waters.
Soon the sailors began to give way to their fears.
The thought that they were on seas where no man had
before ventured filled them with alarm. They remembered
all the strange stories that they had heard
of dreadful monsters and of mysterious dangers, and
their minds were filled with distress.</p>

<p>But Columbus showed them how unreasonable these
stories were; and he aroused their curiosity by telling
them wonderful things about India&mdash;that land of
gold and precious stones, which they would surely
reach if they would bravely persevere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, day after day, they sailed onward. The sea
was calm, and the wind blowing from the east drove
the ships steadily forward. By the first of October
they had sailed more than two thousand miles. Birds
came from the west, and flew about the ships. The
water was full of floating seaweed. But still no land
could be seen.</p>

<p>Then the sailors began to fear that they would never
be able to return against the east wind that was blowing.
“Why should we obey this man, Columbus?”
they said. “He is surely mad. Let us throw him into
the sea, and then turn the ships about while we can.”</p>

<p>But Columbus was so firm and brave that they
dared not lay hands on him; they dared not disobey
him. Soon they began to see signs of the nearness of
land. Weeds, such as grow only in rivers, were seen
floating near the ships. A branch of a tree, with berries
on it, was picked up. Columbus offered a reward to
the man who should first see land.</p>

<p>“We must be very near it now,” he said.</p>

<p>That night no one could sleep. At about two o’clock
the man who was on the lookout on one of the smaller
vessels cried: “Land! land! land!” Columbus himself
had seen a distant light moving, some hours before.
There was now a great stir on board the ships.</p>

<p>“Where is the land?” cried every one.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;there! Straight before us.”</p>

<p>Yes, there was a low, dark mass far in front of them,
which might be land. In the dim starlight, it was hard
to make out what it was. But one thing was certain,
it was not a mere expanse of water, such as lay in every
other direction. And so the sailors brought out a little
old-fashioned cannon and fired it off as a signal to the
crews of the other vessels. Then the sails of the three
ships were furled, and they waited for the light of day.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, Columbus and his companions
saw that they were quite near to a green and
sunny island. It was a beautiful spot. There were
pleasant groves where the songs of birds were heard.
Thousands of flowers were seen on every hand, and the
trees were laden with fruit. The island was inhabited,
too; for strange men could be seen running toward the
shore and looking with wonder at the ships.</p>

<p>The sailors, who had lately been ready to give up all
hope, were now filled with joy. They crowded around
Columbus, and kissed his hands, and begged him to
forgive them for thinking of disobeying him. The
ships cast anchor, the boats were lowered, and Columbus,
with most of the men, went on shore. Columbus
was dressed in a grand robe of scarlet, and the banner of
Spain was borne above him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the boats reached the shore, Columbus
stepped out and knelt down upon the beach and gave
thanks to God; then he took possession of the island
in the name of the king and queen of Spain, and called
it San Salvador. It was thus that the first land in
America was discovered on the 12th of October, 1492.</p>

<p>The natives were filled with wonder at what they
saw. At first they were awed and frightened at sight
of the ships and the strange men; but they soon overcame
their fears and seemed delighted and very friendly.
They brought to Columbus gifts of all they had,&mdash;bananas,
yams, oranges, and beautiful birds.</p>

<p>“Surely,” they said, “these wonderful beings who
have come to us from the sea are not mere men like ourselves.
They must be messengers from heaven.”</p>

<p>Columbus believed that this island was near the coast
of Asia, and that it was one of the islands of India;
and so he called the people Indians. He did not remain
here long, but sailed away to discover other lands.
In a short time the ships came to a large island where
there were rivers of fresh water flowing into the sea.
The air was sweet with the breath of blossoms; the
sky was blue and clear; the sea was calm; the world
seemed full of joy and peace. This island was Cuba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us live here always!” cried the sailors; “for
surely this is paradise.”</p>

<p>And so, for three months and more, Columbus and
his companions sailed among scenes of delight, such as
they had never before imagined. They visited island
after island, and everywhere saw new beauties and
new pleasures. The natives were simple-hearted and
kind. “They love their neighbors as themselves,”
said Columbus. They looked with wonder upon the
bright swords of the white men and upon their brilliant
armor; and when the little cannon was fired, they were
so filled with alarm that they fell to the ground.</p>

<p>It was on the 15th of the next March that Columbus,
after a stormy homeward voyage, sailed again into the
little harbor of Palos, from which he had started. And
now there was a greater stir in the little town than
there had been before. “Christopher Columbus has
come back from the unknown seas!” was the cry that
went from house to house.</p>

<p>“Did he reach the East by sailing west? Has he
really been to far-off India?” asked the doubting ones.</p>

<p>“He has, indeed!” was the answer. “He has discovered
a new world.”</p>

<p>Then the bells were rung, guns were fired, and bonfires
blazed on the hilltops. Everybody rejoiced. Everybody
was willing now to say that the Italian sailor was
right when he declared the earth to be round.</p>

College at the age of sixteen, but at the end of two years took honorable
dismission and engaged in the study of law. He was admitted to the bar
in 1815; removed to New York in 1825; was editor of the <i>New York
Review</i> in the same year; and in 1826 became connected with the
<i>Evening Post</i>, with which he continued until his death, which occurred
in 1878.</p>

German Catholic writer, Monsignor Joseph Bischoff, who was
born in August, 1828. He was made a Papal Chamberlain to Pope

Indian Tribes of the United States</i>, <i>Early Voyages up and down the Mississippi</i>,
<i>History of the Catholic Church in Colonial Times</i>, are some of

them.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_196"><span class="smcap">Page 196.</span></a>&mdash;<b>Francis Scott Key</b>, author of “The Star-spangled
Banner,” was born in Frederick County, Maryland, in 1780. It was

man-of-war within sight of the bombardment of Fort McHenry, that Key
wrote this beautiful lyrical poem. He died at Baltimore in 1843.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
